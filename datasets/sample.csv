Is confident of a positive and fair result from the Interministerial Committee which has just been set up, and recognises that the Cambodian authorities have made efforts to combat trafficking in women and children; underlines, however, the need to increase the number of prosecutions and convictions of traffickers so to put an end to trafficking in women and child prostitution; #NP# 10.

1,32005R0394,en,2005,"Commission Regulation (EC) No 394/2005 #NP# of 8 March 2005 #NP# amending Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the single payment scheme provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, and derogating from Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 #NP# THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, #NP# Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 [1], and in particular Article 145(c) and (d) and (q) thereof, #NP# Whereas: #NP# (1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 [2] introduces the implementing rules for the single payment scheme that will apply from 2005. The administrative and operational implementation of the scheme which has started, on that basis, at national level, has shown the need of further detailed rules on some aspects of the scheme and to clarify and adapt certain aspects of the existing rules. #NP# (2) In particular, it is appropriate to specify the application of the definition of multiannual crops in relation to the eligibility conditions for land to be put on set-aside and in relation to the energy crops aid scheme referred to in Article 88 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. #NP# (3) For administrative reasons, in order to limit the creation of fractions of payment entitlements to the extent necessary, Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 provides that in case of transfer, before splitting an existing entitlement, all existing fractions should be used. It is appropriate to specify that that provision should refer to existing fractions of entitlements of the same nature, such as normal entitlements, set-aside entitlements, entitlements accompanied by an authorisation in accordance with Article 60 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. #NP# (4) According to Article 7(6) of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004, farmers who leased or sold hectares shall not benefit from the mechanism provided for in that Article. As far as the aim of that mechanism is not undermined by the fact of buying and selling or leasing an equivalent number of hectares, it should be provided that the mechanism should also apply in those cases. #NP# (5) Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 provides for the reversion to the national reserve of a part of the reference amount in particular situations. For administrative reasons it is appropriate to allow Member States to apply such reduction above a ceiling to be defined. #NP# (6) Article 21(4) of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 assimilates lease to purchase of land for investment purpose. Investments in production capacity made under the form of a lease should also be taken into account. #NP# (7) Article 22(2) of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 aims to take into account the cases of farmers who find themselves in special situations deriving from the fact of having bought land that was under a lease during the reference period. It is appropriate to specify the scope of application of the provision by giving a definition of the condition of the lease to be taken into account. #NP# (8) The second subparagraph of Article 46(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides that, except in case of force majeure or exceptional circumstances, a farmer may transfer his payment entitlements without land only after he has used, within the meaning of Article 44 of that Regulation, at least 80 % of his payment entitlements during at least one calendar year or, after he has given up voluntarily to the national reserve all the payment entitlements he has not used in the first year of application of the single payment scheme. It is appropriate to specify the conditions of application of that provision. #NP# (9) Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly. #NP# (10) From 1 January 2006, Article 51 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 864/2004 [3], authorises Member States to allow secondary crops to be cultivated on the eligible hectares during a period of maximum three months starting each year on 15 August. Taking into account that until 31 December 2004 such practices are compatible with the existing rules on direct payments and that farmers could again be authorised under that new provision from 1 January 2006, the fact of interrupting such practices for one year would result in severe economical problems for farmers used to such practices and would also provoke practical and specific problems in terms of eligibility of the land. Therefore, in order to guarantee the continuity of the measure and to allow farmers, in Member States where such decision would be taken, to take their sowing decisions in time, it is necessary and duly justified to provide, by way of derogation from Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, for the application in 2005 of that option. #NP# (11) Due to the fact that the single payment scheme is applicable starting from 1 January 2005, it is appropriate that this Regulation applies retroactively from that date. #NP# (12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments, #NP# HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: #NP# Article 1 #NP# Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 is amended as follows: #NP# 1. in Article 2, points (c) and (d) are replaced by the following: #NP# ""c) ""permanent crops"" shall mean non-rotational crops other than permanent pasture that occupy the land for five years or longer and yield repeated harvests including nurseries as defined in point (G/5) of Annex I to Commission Decision 2000/115/EC [4], with the exception of multiannual crops and the nurseries of such multiannual crops. #NP# For the purpose of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and in case of areas which are also subject to an application for the aid for energy crops provided for in Article 88 of that Regulation, short rotation coppice (CN code ex06029041) Miscanthus sinensis (CN code ex06029051) Phalaris arundicea (reed canary grass) (CN code ex12149090) shall be considered as multiannual crops. However, for the purpose of Article 44(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, shall be considered as eligible hectares: #NP# - the areas planted with those crops between 30 April 2004 and 10 March 2005, #NP# - the areas planted with these crops before 30 April 2004 and leased or acquired, between 30 April 2004 and 10 March 2005 in view of applying for the single payment scheme. #NP# d) ""multiannual crops"" shall mean crops of the following products: #NP# CN code | | #NP# 07091000 | Artichokes | #NP# 07092000 | Asparagus | #NP# 07099090 | Rhubarb | #NP# 081020 | Raspberries, blackberries, mulberries and loganberries | #NP# 081030 | Black-, white- or redcurrants and gooseberries | #NP# 081040 | Cranberries, bilberries and other fruits of the genus Vaccinium | #NP# 2. in Article 3, paragraph 4 is replaced by the following: #NP# ""4. Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall apply only if the farmer still needs to declare or transfer a payment entitlement or a fraction of a payment entitlement with a fraction of a hectare after having declared or transferred existing payment entitlements or fractions of payment entitlements of the same nature.""; #NP# 3. in Article 7, paragraph 6 is replaced by the following: #NP# ""6. For the purpose of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4, hectares transferred by sale or by lease, and not replaced by a corresponding number of hectares, shall be included in the number of hectares which the farmer declares.""; #NP# 4. in Article 10 the following paragraph 6 is added: #NP# ""6. Member States may fix a ceiling above which paragraph 1 shall apply.""; #NP# 5. in Article 21, paragraph 4 is replaced by the following: #NP# ""4. Long term lease of six and more years started by 15 May 2004 at the latest shall be considered as a purchase of land or investment in production capacity for the application of paragraph 1.""; #NP# 6. in Article 22(2), the following subparagraph is added: #NP# ""For the purposes of application of this paragraph, ""land under a lease"" shall mean land which was, at the time of, or after the purchase under a lease which has never been renewed except when the renewal was imposed by a legal obligation."" #NP# 7. in Article 25, the following paragraph is added: #NP# ""4. For the application of the second subparagraph of Article 46(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the percentage of the payment entitlements the farmer has used shall be calculated on the number of payment entitlements allocated to him in the first year of application of the single payment scheme, with the exception of payment entitlements sold with land, and must be used during one calendar year.""; #NP# 8. Article 47 is replaced by the following: #NP# ""Article 47 #NP# Overrun of the ceilings #NP# Where the sum of the amounts to be paid under each of the schemes provided for in Articles 66 to 71 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 exceeds the ceiling fixed in accordance with Article 64(2) of that Regulation, the amount to be paid shall be reduced proportionately in the year concerned."" #NP# Article 2 #NP# By way of derogation from Article 51 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, Member States may decide for the year 2005 to apply the second subparagraph of Article 51(b) of that Regulation as amended by Regulation (EC) No 864/2004. #NP# Article 3 #NP# This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# It shall apply from 1 January 2005. #NP# This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. #S# Done at Brussels, 8 March 2005. #NP# For the Commission #NP# Mariann Fischer Boel #NP# Member of the Commission #NP# [1] OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 1.

Welcomes the introduction in the Court of Auditors' Annual Report for 2003 of a separate section for the Council; notes the Council's summary of internal audits carried out in 2003; welcomes the enhanced exchange of information between the Council and Parliament through the informal dialogue that has taken place between the two institutions as part of the discharge procedure; finds that these elements have helped to increase transparency with regard to discharge of the Council's budget; #NP# 2. Notes the Council's intention to provide the documentation and adopt the outstanding actions needed to comply with the requirements of the new Financial Regulation, as specified in the Court of Auditors' Annual Report, by the end of 2004 and asks the Council to submit to the European Parliament a list of problems occurring with implementation of the Financial Regulation; #NP# 3. Notes the Court's observation that the Council's legal services were contracted without any tendering procedure, although their value exceeded the threshold above which a tendering procedure was required; notes that the Council fully accepts this observation and has initiated a tendering procedure in order to establish a framework contract for the type of legal services mentioned; stresses the importance of respecting the rules on procurement set out in the Financial Regulation; #NP# 4. Asks the Council to make available to the discharge authority, as all other institutions have done including the European Parliament, the annual activity report referred to in Article 60(7) of the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002; #NP# 5. Finds that greater clarity with regard to spending on and the management of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) within the Council would enhance transparency; urges the Council separately to identify CFSP preparatory costs within its budget, as recommended by the Court of Auditors in its Special Report No 13/2001; stresses the need for clarification of the Commission's role in the implementation of CFSP, as recommended by the Court of Auditors in its Special Report No 13/2001; recommends that clear operational principles and arrangements with regard to the Commission's role in implementation of the CFSP be included in the new interinstitutional agreement on the budget; #NP# 6.

The criteria for eco labels should therefore not apply to those substances where less than 0,1 % of the substance in the treated part remains in the form as observed before application. #NP# (5) The ecological criteria and the related assessment and verification requirements should be valid for a period of four years. #NP# (6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, #NP# HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: #NP# Article 1 #NP# The product group ""lubricants"" shall comprise hydraulic oils, greases, chainsaw oils, two stroke oils, concrete release agents and other total loss lubricants, for use by consumers and professional users. #NP# Article 2 #NP# 1. For the purpose of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply: #NP# (a) ""lubricant"" means a preparation consisting of base fluids and additives; #NP# (b) ""base fluid"" means a lubricating fluid whose flow, ageing, lubricity and anti-wear properties, as well as its properties regarding contaminant suspension, have not been improved by the inclusion of additives; #NP# (c) ""thickener"" means a substance in the base fluid used to thicken or modify the rheology of a lubricating fluid or grease; #NP# (d) ""main component"" means any substance accounting for more than 5 % by weight of the lubricant; #NP# (e) ""additive"" means a substance whose primary functions are the improvement of the flow, ageing, lubricity, anti-wear properties or of contaminant suspension; #NP# (f) ""grease"" means a solid to semi-solid preparation which consists of a thickening agent in a liquid lubricant. #NP# 2. In the case of greases, other ingredients imparting special properties may be included. #NP# Article 3 #NP# In order to be awarded the Community eco-label for lubricants under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, a lubricant must fall within the product group ""lubricants"" and must comply with the criteria set out in the Annex to this Decision. #NP# The criteria shall apply to the freshly manufactured product at the time of delivery. #NP# Where criteria are formulated in terms of constituent substances, those criteria shall apply to any substance which has been deliberately added and which constitutes more than 0,1 % of the product‚Äôs content, as measured both before and after any chemical reaction has taken place between the substances mixed to provide the lubricant preparation. #NP# The criteria shall not, however, apply to a substance which, on application, changes its chemical nature so as no longer to warrant classification according to Directive 1999/45/EC, and of which less than 0,1 % in the treated part remains in its pre-application form. #NP# Article 4 #NP# The ecological criteria for the product group ""lubricants"", and the related assessment and verification requirements, shall be valid until 31 May 2009. #NP# Article 5 #NP# For administrative purposes, the code number assigned to the product group ""lubricants"" shall be ""27"". #NP# Article 6 #NP# This Decision is addressed to the Member States. #S# Done at Brussels, 26 April 2005. #NP# For the Commission #NP# Stavros Dimas #NP# Member of the Commission #NP# [1] OJ L 237, 21.9.2000, p. 1. #NP# [2] OJ L 200, 30.7.1999, p. 1.

The supplier of the additive, additive package or base fluid may provide the relevant information directly to the competent body. #NP# Where appropriate, test methods other than those indicated for each criterion may be used if the competent body assessing the application accepts their equivalence. #NP# Where appropriate, competent bodies may require supporting documentation and may carry out independent verifications. #NP# The competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or EN ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria #NP# (NB: it is not required to implement such management schemes.) #NP# CRITERIA #NP# 1. R-phrases indicating environmental and human health hazards #NP# The product shall not have been assigned any R-phrase at the time of applying for the eco label, indicating environmental and human health hazards according to Directive 1999/45/EC. The following R-phrases are considered relevant for this product group: #NP# R 20, R 21, R 22, R 23, R 24, R 25, R 26, R 27, R 28, R 33, R 34, R 35, R 36, R 37, R 38, R 39, R 40, R 41, R 42, R 43, R 45, R 46, R 48, R 49, R 50, R 51, R 52, R 53, R 59, R 60, R 61, R 62, R 63, R 64, R 65, R 66, R 67, R 68, and combinations thereof. #NP# Assessment and verification of criterion 1 #NP# Conformity with criterion 1 shall be stated in writing and signed by the applicant company. #NP# All main components included in the product shall be unambiguously stated, giving their names and where applicable, their Einecs or Elincs number and the concentrations in which they are used. #NP# The producer of the product shall provide the competent body with: #NP# - a product safety data sheet (meeting the requirements of Commission Directive 91/155/EEC [1]). #NP# - safety data sheets of applicant suppliers (meeting the requirements of Directive 91/155/EEC and Council Directive 67/548/EEC [2]) for each main component. #NP# Sufficient data shall be available to allow for the evaluation of the environmental hazards (indicated by the R-phrases: R 50, R 50/53, R 51/53, R 52, R 52/53, R 53), of the product in accordance with Directives 91/155/EEC and 1999/45/EC. #NP# The evaluation of a product for hazards to the environment shall be performed by the conventional method as indicated in Annex III to Directive 1999/45/EC. However, as defined by part C of Annex III to that Directive, the results of testing the preparation (either the product preparation or the additive package) as such can be used to modify the classification concerning the aquatic toxicity that would have been obtained using the conventional method. #NP# 2. Additional aquatic toxicity requirements #NP# The applicant shall demonstrate compliance by meeting the requirements of either criterion 2.1 or criterion 2.2. #NP# Criterion 2.1. Requirements for the preparation and main components #NP# Data are required on the aquatic toxicity of: #NP# - the preparation, and #NP# - the main components. #NP# The critical concentration for the aquatic toxicity of each main component shall be at least 100 mg/l. The test shall be carried out on algae and daphnia (OECD 201 and 202). #NP# For hydraulic oils the critical concentration for the aquatic toxicity shall be at least 100 mg/l. #NP# For greases, chainsaw oils, concrete release agents and other total loss lubricants the critical concentration for the aquatic toxicity shall be at least 1000 mg/l. #NP# Greases may be evaluated by providing data for the preparation and the main components only if the thickener shows ultimate biodegradation (see criterion 3) or inherent biodegradation according to: #NP# - a biodegradation > 70 % in the OECD 302 C test for inherent biodegradation or equivalent test methods, or #NP# - a biodegradation > 20 % but < 60 % after 28 days in the OECD 301 tests based on oxygen depletion or carbon dioxide generation, or #NP# - biodegradation > 60 % in ISO 14593 (CO2 headspace test). #NP# The test on the preparation shall be carried out on all three groups of species (OECD 201, 202, and 203). #NP# Table 1 summarises the requirements for the different product subgroups according to criterion 2.1. #NP# Table 1 #NP# Aquatic toxicity requirements for the different product subgroups ‚Äî Data requirements for the preparation and main components #NP# Criterion 2.1 | Hydraulic fluids | Greases [3] | Chainsaw oils, concrete release agents and other total loss lubricants | Two-stroke oils | #NP# Aquatic toxicity for the fully formulated product in all three of the acute toxicity tests OECD 201, 202 and 203 | ‚â• 100 mg/l | ‚â• 1000 mg/l | ‚â• 1000 mg/l | ‚â• 1000 mg/l | #NP# Aquatic toxicity for each individual main component in OECD 201 and 202 | ‚â• 100 mg/l | ‚â• 100 mg/l | ‚â• 100 mg/l | ‚â• 100 mg/l | #NP# Assessment and verification of criterion 2.1 #NP# Reports shall be submitted to the competent body including the data on the aquatic toxicity of the preparation and all main components by making use of either existing material from registrations or new tests, allowing compliance to be demonstrated with the requirements set out in table 1. #NP# The aquatic toxicity of the preparation shall be determined according to the OECD 201, 202 and 203 or equivalent methods. #NP# The aquatic toxicity of each individual main component shall be determined according to the OECD 201 and 202 or equivalent methods. #NP# Criterion 2.2. Requirements for each constituent substance #NP# Aquatic toxicity data shall be provided for each constituent substance intentionally added in the product. One or more substances exhibiting a certain degree of aquatic toxicity are allowed in the lubricant for a cumulative mass concentration as indicated in Table 2. #NP# Table 2 #NP# Aquatic toxicity requirements for the different product subgroups ‚Äî Data requirements for each constituent substance #NP# Criterion 2.2 | Cumulative mass concentration of substances present in | #NP# Aquatic toxicity | Hydraulic fluids | Greases | Chainsaw oils, concrete release agents and other total loss lubricants | Two-stroke oils | #NP# 10 mg/l < Acute toxicity [4] ‚â§ 100 mg/l or 1 mg/l < NOEC ‚â§ 10 mg/l | ‚â§ 20 | ‚â§ 25 | ‚â§ 5 | ‚â§ 25 | #NP# 1 mg/l < Acute toxicity [4] ‚â§ 10 mg/l or 0,1 mg/l < NOEC ‚â§ 1 mg/l | ‚â§ 5 | ‚â§ 1 | ‚â§ 0,5 | ‚â§ 1 | #NP# Acute toxicity [4] < 1 mg/l or NOEC ‚â§ 0,1 mg/l | ‚â§ 1 | ‚â§ 0,1 | ‚â§ 0,1 | ‚â§ 0,1 | #NP# Assessment and verification of criterion 2.2 #NP# Reports shall be submitted to the competent body including the data on the aquatic toxicity of each constituent substance by making use of either existing material from registrations or new tests, demonstrating compliance with the requirements set out in Table 2. #NP# The aquatic toxicity of each constituent substance shall be determined according to the OECD 201 and 202 or equivalent methods. #NP# Assessment and verification of both criteria 2.1 and 2.2 #NP# In the case of slightly soluble components (< 10 mg/l) the method of the water accommodated fraction (WAF) can be used in the aquatic toxicity determination. The established loading level, sometimes referred to as LL50 and related to the lethal loading, may be used directly in the classification criteria. The preparation of a water accommodated fraction shall follow the recommendations set out according to one of the following guidelines; ECETOC Technical Report No 20 (1986), Annex III to OECD 1992 301 or the ISO Guidance document ISO 10634, or ASTM D6081-98 (Standard practice for Aquatic Toxicity Testing for Lubricants: Sample Preparation and Results Interpretation or equivalent methods). #NP# The acute aquatic toxicity study on algae and daphnia (OECD 201 and 202) does not need to be conducted when: #NP# - the substance is unlikely to cross biological membranes MM > 800 or molecular diameter > 1,5 nm (> 15 √Ö), #NP# - or the substance is highly insoluble in water (water solubility < 10 Œºg/l), #NP# as such substances are not regarded as toxic for algae and daphnia in the aquatic system. #NP# Similarly, the acute aquatic toxicity study on daphnia (OECD 202) does not need to be considered when a long-term toxicity study on Daphnia‚Äôs according to OECD 211 or equivalent one is available. #NP# The water solubility of substances shall be determined where appropriate according to OECD 105 (or equivalent tests). #NP# If chronic toxicity data are available (results of OECD 210 and 211 tests or equivalent methods), these may be used instead of acute aquatic toxicity data. Absence of chronic toxicity data shall be stated in writing and signed by the applicant. #NP# 3. Biodegradability and bioaccumulative potential #NP# The product shall not contain substances that are both: #NP# - non-biodegradable, #NP# and #NP# - (potentially) bioaccumulative. #NP# However, the product may contain one or more substances with a certain degree of degradability and potential or actual bioaccumulation up to a cumulative mass concentration as indicated in Table 3. #NP# Table 3 #NP# Requirements for biodegradability and bioaccumulative potential #NP# | Cumulative mass concentration of substances is | #NP# Biodegradation | Hydraulic fluids | Greases | Chainsaw oils, concrete release agents and other total loss lubricants | Two-stroke oils | #NP# Non-biodegradable [5] | ‚â§ 5 | ‚â§ 10 | ‚â§ 5 | ‚â§ 10 | #NP# Inherently aerobically biodegradable | ‚â§ 5 | ‚â§ 20 | ‚â§ 5 | ‚â§ 20 | #NP# Ultimately aerobically biodegradable | ‚â• 90 | ‚â• 75 | ‚â• 90 | ‚â• 75 | #NP# Assessment and verification of criterion 3 #NP# Conformity shall be demonstrated by providing the following information: #NP# - reports including the data on the biodegradability of each constituent substance if this is not adequately shown on the safety data sheets provided for each substance, #NP# - reports including the data on the bioaccumulative potential of each constituent substance: #NP# - for non-biodegradable substances, and #NP# - for toxic and very toxic substances that are readily biodegradable (for classification purposes). #NP# The biodegradability shall be determined for each constituent substance in the product separately by test methods specified below (or equivalent tests). #NP# A substance is considered ultimately biodegradable (aerobic) if: #NP# 1. In a 28-day biodegradation study according to OECD 301 A-F or equivalent tests the following levels of biodegradation are achieved: #NP# - in OECD 301 tests based upon dissolved organic carbon ‚â• 70 %, #NP# - in OECD 301 tests based upon oxygen depletion or carbonic dioxide generation ‚â• 60 % of the theoretical maxima. #NP# 2. The BOD5/ThOD or BOD5/COD ratio is larger than 0,5. #NP# In the OECD test the 10-day window principle will not necessarily apply. If the substance reaches the biodegradation pass level within 28 days but not within the 10-day time-window, a slower degradation rate is assumed. #NP# A substance is considered inherently biodegradable if it shows: #NP# - a biodegradation > 70 % in the OECD 302 C test for inherent biodegradation or equivalent test method, or #NP# - a biodegradation > 20 % but < 60 % after 28 days in the OECD 301 tests based on oxygen depletion or carbon dioxide generation, or #NP# - biodegradation ‚â• 60 % in ISO 14593 (CO2 headspace test). #NP# A substance whose primary function is thickening shall be considered inherently aerobically biodegradable if it shows a biodegradation higher than 20 % in the OECD 302 C for inherent biodegradation or equivalent test methods. All of the aquatic toxicity requirements shall then apply also to the degradation products, which have been scientifically proven to be derivates of the thickener, after exposure to the aquatic environment. #NP# A substance is non-biodegradable if it fails the criteria for ultimate and inherent biodegradability. #NP# A substance does not bioaccumulate if its MM > 800 or has a molecular diameter > 1,5 nm (> 15 √Ö). #NP# A substance with MM < 800 or molecular diameter < 1,5 nm (< 15 √Ö) does not bioaccumulate if: #NP# - the octanol-water partition coefficient log Kow < 3 or > 7, or #NP# - the measured BCF is ‚â§ 100. Since most substances used in lubricants are quite hydrophobic the BCF-value should be based on the lipid weight content and care must be shown to ensure a sufficient exposure time. #NP# Test methods #NP# The tests to be applied for the determination of ready biodegradability are the OECD 301 A-F series, or ISO and ASTM equivalents or the BOD5/(ThOD or COD) ratio. The BOD5/(ThOD or COD) ratio can only be used if no data based on the OECD 301 or any other equivalent test methods are available. The BOD5 shall be assessed according to C.5 (Commission Directive 92/69/EEC [6]) or equivalent methods while the COD according to C.6 (Directive 92/69/EEC) or equivalent methods. For the determination of the inherent biodegradability the OECD 302 C or equivalent test methods are to be applied. #NP# The applicant may also use read-across data to estimate the biodegradability of a substance. ""Read-across"" for the assessment of the biodegradability of a substance shall be acceptable if the reference substance differs by only one functional group or fragment from the substance applied in the product. If the reference substance is readily or inherently biodegradable and the functional group has a positive effect on the aerobic biodegradation then the applied substance may also be regarded as readily or inherently biodegradable. Functional groups or fragments with a positive effect on the biodegradation are: aliphatic and aromatic alcohol [-OH], aliphatic and aromatic acid [-C(=O)-OH], aldehyde [-CHO], Ester [-C(=O)-O-C], amide [-C(=O)‚ÄìN of -C(=S)‚ÄìN]. Adequate and reliable documentation of the study on the reference substance should be provided. In case of a comparison with a fragment, not included here above, adequate and reliable documentation of the studies should be provided on the positive effect of the functional group on the biodegradation of structurally similar substances. #NP# The log octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow) shall be assessed according to OECD 107, 117 or the draft 123 or any other equivalent test method. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) shall be assessed according to OECD 305. #NP# Log Kow values are applicable to organic chemicals only. To assess the bioaccumulation potential of non-organic compounds, some surfactants, and some organo-metallic compounds, BCF measurements shall be carried out. #NP# If the test cannot be performed (e.g. the substance has a high surface activity or does not dissolve in water or in octanol), a calculated value for log Kow as well as details of the calculation method shall be provided. #NP# The following calculation methods are allowed for the log Kow: CLOGP for a log Kow between 0 and 9, LOGKOW (KOWWIN) for a log Kow between ‚Äì 4 and 8, AUTOLOGP for a log Kow greater than 5 as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 [7], which is supported by a technical guidance document (TGD). #NP# 4.

BACKGROUND #NP# Date of transmission of the Commission Proposal to the EP and the Council (document COM (2003) 723 final 2003/0282 (COD) | 24 November 2003 | #NP# Date of the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee: | 28 April 2004 | #NP# Date of the opinion of the Committee of the Regions | 22 May 2004 | #NP# Date of the opinion of the European Parliament, first reading: | 20 April 2004 | #NP# Date of adoption of the Common Position : | 18 July 2005 | #NP# 2. OBJECTIVE OF THE COMMISSION PROPOSAL #NP# The purpose of the Commission‚Äôs proposal for a new Directive on batteries and accumulators was twofold: #NP# - it aims to establish a closed-loop system for all batteries and accumulators, to avoid their incineration or disposal in landfill when they became waste. On the basis of the closed-loop system, all batteries would have had to be collected and recycled, and their metals re-introduced into the economic cycle; #NP# - to set minimum rules for the functioning of national collection and recycling schemes, in order to enhance the proper functioning of the internal market and to guarantee a level playing field for all operators involved in the life cycle of batteries and accumulators. #NP# 3. COMMENTS ON THE COMMON POSITION #NP# 3.1 General comments #NP# The Commission could accept most of the amendments that the European Parliament proposed at first reading. These amendments contain useful technical clarifications or additions to the proposed definitions in the Commission's proposal . The Commission rejected a majority of the amendments related to the substance ban, since its Extended Impact Assessment showed that the proposed ‚Äúclosed-loop‚Äù system would entail an equivalent level of environmental protection at lower costs. In particular: #NP# - The Commission fully accepted amendments 4, 5, 11, 12, 14, 21, 24, 46, 47, 50, 51, 52, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 64, 78, 79, 80, 81, 103 and 112, in total 26 amendments. #NP# - The Commission accepted 16 amendments in part or in principle. Amendments 10, 29 and 35 can be accepted by the Commission in principle subject to re-wording and/or clarification. Amendments 16, 20, 22, 23, 27, 28, 40, 43, 44, 48, 53, 99 and 109 were accepted in part. #NP# - Amendments 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 18, 19, 25, 26, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 45, 49, 54, 55, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 85, 92, 95, 82, 100, 101, 108 and 120, in total 44 amendments, were not accepted by the Commission. #NP# The Council has to a large extent taken account of the Parliamentary amendments and has made a number of further changes. The Council considered that the proposed ‚Äúclosed-loop‚Äù system would be difficult to achieve in practice and would entail high costs and administrative burdens for Member States. Therefore, the Council preferred a partial ban on the use cadmium in portable batteries, instead of an additional collection target for portable cadmium batteries, which would have required the monitoring of the waste stream. #NP# The Commission stands by its Extended Impact Assessment (see also the Commission‚Äôs statement under paragraph 4), but also accepts that there is now new information available, which shows that the proposed ‚Äúclosed-loop‚Äù system may entail a higher administrative burden and higher costs than initially estimated, i.e. more costs for Member States. Therefore, the Commission can accept policy measures other than those proposed in its initial proposal, provided that the level of environmental ambition is at least equivalent to the Commission‚Äôs proposal, in particular with respect to collection and recycling objectives. #NP# As regards the collection rates, the Commission welcomes the increase of the long term collection target. However, the time-frame for achieving the 45% collection rate (8 years after the transposition date) could be more ambitious. #NP# On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission can support the common position taken as a package. #NP# 3.2 Detailed comments #NP# 3.2.1. Parliamentary amendments accepted by the Commission and incorporated in full, in part or in principle in the common position #NP# Amendments 4, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 20, 21, 23, 24, 28, 35, 40, 43, 44, 46, 51, 52, 53, 56, 57, 59-62, 64, 78, 79-81, 99, 109 and 112 adopted by the European Parliament in first reading, were accepted, in full, in part or in principle by the Commission. They are also in full, in part or in principle incorporated in the Council‚Äôs common position. #NP# Amendments 4 and 52 change the word ‚Äòconsumer‚Äô into ‚Äòend-user‚Äô. They were fully accepted by the Commission. They are incorporated in recital 18 and the title of Article 17 of the common position. The part of amendment 53 related to end-users was accepted by the Commission is also is partly incorporated in Article 17 (1) of the common position. #NP# Amendment 10 clarifies the scope of the Directive and was in principle accepted by the Commission. It is incorporated in Article 2 of the common position. #NP# Amendments 11, 12 and 14 contain useful clarifications to the definitions of ‚Äòbattery‚Äô, ‚Äòaccumulator‚Äô and ‚Äòbattery pack‚Äô and were fully be accepted by the Commission. They are incorporated in Article 3 (1), (2) and (3) of the common position. #NP# The Commission accepted amendment 16 in part, since the Commission welcomed the clarification that button cells can also be used as back-up power. This is incorporated in Article 3 (4) of the common position. #NP# As regards the proposed definition of producer, amendment 20 was partly accepted by the Commission. The Commission suggested the following wording for Article 3 (13) (b): ‚Äúresells batteries or accumulators under his own brand on the condition that the brand of the producer no longer appears on the batteries or accumulators‚Äù . For the amendment related to subparagraph (c) the Commission suggested the following wording: ‚Äú(..) into the Community market from third countries‚Äù . The Council‚Äôs definition of producer is partly consistent with amendment 20, in that it covers all batteries and accumulators incorporated into appliances. The Council has further simplified the definition, in order to allow Member States to identify a responsible producer on their national territory while at the same time avoiding concerns related to the internal market. #NP# Amendment 21 adds a definition of ‚Äòdistributor‚Äô which was fully accepted by the Commission. It is incorporated in Article 3 (13) of the common position. #NP# The Commission accepted the first two parts of amendment 23, namely that Article 4 applies without prejudice to Directive 2000/53/EC and the 5 ppm weight limit for mercury batteries and accumulators, since both changes are in line with Commission Proposal. The Council partly accepted this amendment in that Article 4 of the common position provides for a cadmium ban, subject to exemptions, and for a review. #NP# Amendment 24 reinforces the obligation on producers to increase the environmental performance of batteries and accumulators and for Member States to promote research in this field. It was fully accepted by the Commission. It is partly incorporated in Article 19 (3) (a) and (d) of the common position. #NP# The Commission partly accepted amendment 28, which rewords the requirements for collection schemes for portable batteries and accumulators. The Commission considered it a useful clarification to add that batteries can also be collected together with electrical and electronic waste on the basis of schemes which were set up implementing this Directive. The common position incorporates this in Article 7 (1) (c). #NP# The Commission could in principle agree to the approach that the Directive itself should establish a list of Member States that may derogate from the proposed recycling targets in an Annex, as suggested by amendment 35. The Council preferred the establishment of transitional arrangements through a comitology procedure (see Article 9 (4) (a) of the common position). #NP# The Commission accepted the correction of the typing error in Regulation 259/93/EEC in amendment 40. The Council incorporated this together with the addition of the word ‚Äòrecycling‚Äô in Article 12 of the common position. #NP# As regards amendment 43, the Commission accepted the re-wording with respect to lead and cadmium recycling. The Commission also welcomed the new paragraph stipulating that the minimum recycling efficiencies could be adapted through comitology in the light of scientific and technical progress. This amendment is incorporated in Article 10 of the common position. #NP# The Commission partially accepted amendment 44, namely the replacement of the word ‚Äòarrange‚Äô by ‚Äòprovide‚Äô as well as the addition of the word ‚Äòcollection‚Äô and ‚Äòenvironmentally‚Äô. Article 13 of the common position partly incorporates this amendment by including the word ‚Äòcollection‚Äô. #NP# The Commission accepted amendment 46, which stipulates that batteries still incorporated in other products such as cars or electrical and electronic equipment at the moment those products become waste, the battery producers will only become responsible for the further treatment of the batteries after their removal from the other products. The Council‚Äôs common position aims to avoid overlap between the different financing schemes and is therefore consistent with the aim of this amendment (see Article 13 (2) of the common position). #NP# Amendment 51 clarifies that the participation in such schemes should be open to all economic operators on a non-discriminatory basis and was accepted by the Commission. The aim of this amendment is incorporated in Article 7 (2) of the common position. #NP# The Commission accepted amendment 56, which would oblige Member States to take appropriate measures to encourage end-users to participate in collection schemes. This is incorporated in Article 17 (1) (b) of the common position. #NP# Amendments 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 78, 79, 80 and 81 move the detailed labelling requirements from Annex II to the Directive to an article. Amendment 59 also deletes the possibility for the Commission to amend the labelling requirements according to technical progress on the basis of a comitology procedure. Amendment 64 inserts the possibility for the Commission to grant exemptions from the labelling requirements on basis of a comitology procedure. The Commission has accepted all these amendments and they are incorporated in the Article 18 of and Annex II to the common position. #NP# The Commission partly accepted amendment 99, namely the deletion of the 10% derogation from the recycling requirement and the possibility of making technical adaptations. This is incorporated in Article 10 (1) (b) of the common position. #NP# The Commission accepted the part of amendment 109 which clarified that automotive batteries should be collected ‚Äòfrom the end-user or from an accessible place in their vicinity‚Äô. This is incorporated in the common position in article 7 (4). #NP# Amendment 112 clarifies that the use of visible fees is prohibited for the sale of new products. These amendments were accepted by the Commission and are incorporated in Article 13 (3) of the common position. #NP# 3.2.2. Parliamentary amendments accepted in full, in part or in principle by the Commission but not incorporated in the common position #NP# Amendments 5, 22, 27, 29, 47, 48, 50, 58 and 103 were accepted by the Commission, in full, in part or in principle, but are not incorporated in the common position. #NP# Amendments 5 and 58 stipulate that end-users should be informed about the capacity of the batteries and that the capacity should be indicated on the battery pack. They were fully accepted by the Commission. The Council did not incorporate these amendments in its common position, since they considered it inappropriate to indicate the capacity for technical reasons. #NP# In amendment 22 related to the definition of the ‚Äúclosed-loop‚Äù system, the Commission welcomed the linguistic clarification (a third ‚Äòparty‚Äô, instead of ‚Äòparties‚Äô). As regards amendment 27, the Commission welcomed the first part, which clarifies that Member States should achieve the ‚Äúclosed-loop‚Äù system. The references to a ‚Äúclosed-loop‚Äù system are not incorporated in the common position, since the Council considered the ‚Äúclosed-loop‚Äù system to be a theoretical concept which would be difficult to achieve in practice. #NP# The Commission accepted amendment 29 in principle, which obliges end-users to deliver their spent batteries and accumulators to collection points. Similarly, the Commission welcomed amendment 47 which obliges Member States to ensure that end-users return their batteries to the battery collection schemes. The Council did not include these amendments, since it considered that such obligations for end-users would be difficult to enforce. #NP# Furthermore, the Commission accepted the parts of amendment 48, inserting new provisions clarifying the scope of producer responsibility and stipulating that the size of the guarantee should depend on the hazardousness of the batteries. In order to avoid a gap in financing, the Council decided the principle of producer responsibility should apply both to producers of individual batteries and appliance and car producers who place batteries on the market, while avoiding double charging (see Articles 3 (12), and 13 of the common position). #NP# Amendments 50 and 103, first part, clarify that the cost of the management of historic portable batteries and accumulators should be borne by the producers of these batteries and accumulators according to market share. The Commission considered that this was useful clarification of the application of the producer responsibility principle and in line with Article 8 (3) of the WEEE Directive. The Council however considered that, in order to allow some flexibility for the national systems, it was not necessary to include rules on the financing of historic waste. #NP# 3.2.3. Parliamentary amendments rejected by the Commission and the Council and not incorporated in the common position #NP# Amendments 2, 6, 9, 18, 19, 25, 32, 39, 41, 45, 49, 54, 55, 63, 65, 67, 68, 77, 92, and 101 were rejected by the Commission and not incorporated in the common position of the Council. #NP# 3.2.4 Parliamentary amendments rejected by the Commission, but incorporated in the common position #NP# Amendments 1, 7, 8, 26, 30, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 66, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 82, 85, 95, 100, 108 and 120 were rejected by the Commission, but incorporated in the common position #NP# 3.2.5. Additional changes made by the Council to the Proposal #NP# Recitals #NP# The changes the Council made to the recitals aim at adjusting the text to reflect the various changes made throughout the articles, in particular: #NP# - Recitals 8 and 9 give a non-exhaustive list of examples of industrial and portable batteries and cordless power tools, in order to clarify the definitions in Article 3 (3), (6) and (16). #NP# - Recital 11 incorporates requirements of Articles 5 and 17 (2) of the initial Commission Proposal. Recital 16 explains what is meant by ‚Äòbest available techniques‚Äô in Article 10 (1) (a) of the common position. #NP# - On the financial producer responsibility, Recital 17 clarifies what is meant by ‚Äònet costs‚Äô mentioned in Article 13. #NP# Articles #NP# The main change made by the Council to the articles is the introduction of a limited ban on the use of cadmium in portable batteries (see Article 4 of the common position) instead of the proposed 80% collection target for portable cadmium batteries, which requires the monitoring of the waste stream (see Article 13 of the initial Commission proposal). This should contribute to the achievement of a ‚Äúclosed-loop system‚Äù (see Article 3 (14) of the initial Commission proposal). On the basis of new information on the availability of substitutes for cadmium batteries and the costs of monitoring the waste stream, the Council considered that a limited ban would be a more sustainable policy option than the proposed ‚Äúclosed-loop system‚Äù. In line with these changes, the Council also deleted Articles 3 (14) and 6 of the initial Commission proposal and reworded Article 8 of the initial Commission proposal (now Article 6). It also included the requirement of article 25 (2) of the initial Commission proposal. The reference to the environmental impact of transport replaces the similar requirements in Article 9 (2) and article 15 (1), second paragraph of the initial Commission Proposal. #NP# As regards collection targets, like the European Parliament, the Council preferred to express the collection targets as a percentage instead of in grams per inhabitant as initially proposed by the Commission (see Article 13 of the initial Commission proposal). The Council favoured targets of 25% and 45%, to be achieved respectively 4 and 8 years after the transposition date (see Article 9 of the common position). Since these targets are not linked to the national consumption, it was no longer necessary to keep the possibility of derogations from the targets for reasons of a particularly low battery consumption (see Article 14 (2) of the initial Commission proposal). Instead, the Council proposed to provide for the possible adoption of transitional arrangements on the basis of a comitology procedure (see Article 9 (4) (a) of the common position). #NP# As regards producer responsibility, the Council adopted a new definition of ‚Äúproducer ‚Äù, which would allow Member States to identify a producer on their national territory for the implementation of financial producer responsibility (see Article 3 (12) of the common position). In order to avoid a gap in the financing of the waste management of batteries removed from appliances/cars, appliance manufacturers and car producers are also covered by the definition of ‚Äúproducer‚Äù in this Directive, if the appliance or car incorporates a battery at the moment when it is placed on the market. Article 13 of the common position requires Member States to avoid double charging and clarifies that producers have to finance the net costs related to the waste management of batteries. Article 14 of the common position (replacing Article 22 of the initial Commission proposal) no longer requires producers to provide a guarantee when placing a battery on the market. Article 23 of the initial Commission Proposal establishing rules on the financing of historic waste is deleted. Furthermore, the Council added the possibility of adopting de minimis rules for financing and registration on the basis of a comitology procedure (see Article 15 of the common position). #S#  #S# Annexes #NP# Annex I of the common position contains a table for monitoring compliance with the collection targets and reflects the changes made in Article 9 of the common position. The prescriptive labelling requirements of Annex II have moved to Article 18 of the common position and therefore, like in the European Parliament‚Äôs first reading amendments, Annex II only contains the labelling symbol (crossed-out wheel bin). The detailed treatment and recycling requirements of Articles 15(2) and 19(1) of the initial Commission‚Äôs Proposal have moved to Annex III to the common position. #NP# 4 CONCLUSION #NP# The environmental objective of the Commission‚Äôs Battery Proposal is to prevent the incineration and landfill disposal of all batteries when they become waste In order to achieve this environmental objective, the Commission proposed high collection and recycling targets for all batteries, with a particularly high collection target for portable cadmium batteries, in order to achieve a so-called ‚Äúclosed-loop‚Äù system. #NP# In its common position, the Council preferred other policy measures to achieve the objectives of the Commission‚Äôs Proposal. Since the level of environmental ambition of the Common Position is at least equivalent to the Commission‚Äôs Proposal, the Commission can support the overall package. #NP# Statement by the Commission related to the Council‚Äôs impact assessment: #NP# The Commission underlines the importance of impact assessments being carried out in line with the agreed interinstitutional objectives of better regulation in future. These issues should be further explored between the three Institutions in the ongoing work under the Interinstitutional Agreement, with a view to reaching agreement on a methodology for such impact assessments.",5410;2897;5794;2947;2825;1401,68;10;52,6826;1011;5206,1401;525;2470;1158;2825,1833;5410;1401;525;2897;2470;5794;1158;2947;2825;1401,train

PROCEDURE #NP# (1) By letter dated 21 June 2000, France informed the Commission of the compensation measures it had adopted for fishermen and fish farmers affected by the oil pollution caused by the wreck of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay on 12 December 1999 and the extraordinarily violent storms of 27 and 28 December 1999. At the Commission‚Äôs request, further information was provided by letters dated 28 November 2000, 6 April 2001 and 13 August 2001. Because they were implemented before the Commission could decide whether they were compatible with common market rules, these measures were registered as a non-notified aid scheme, under the number NN 80/2000. #NP# (2) By letter dated 11 December 2001, the Commission notified France of its decision to consider certain of the planned measures compatible with the common market and to initiate the formal investigation procedure provided for in Article 88(2) of the Treaty in respect of the others. France made known its response by letter dated 5 March 2002. #NP# (3) The Commission Decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities [1]. The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments. The Commission received no comments. #NP# II. DESCRIPTION #NP# (4) The formal investigation procedure was initiated in respect of the following measures: #NP# 1. exceptional aid for the fishermen and fish farmers of the departments of Finist√®re, Morbihan, Loire-Atlantique, Vend√©e, Charente-Maritime and Gironde on France‚Äôs Atlantic coast (hereinafter referred to as the Atlantic coast departments from Finist√®re to Gironde). #NP# - exemption from social security contributions for the first quarter of 2000 (or an average quarter), #NP# - reduction of financial charges; #NP# 2. additional measures to assist fish farmers and fishermen throughout France: #NP# - additional measure reducing social security contributions for all fish farmers (from 15 April to 15 July 2000) and fishermen (from 15 April to 15 October 2000) of mainland France and the overseas departments, #NP# - exemption from State fees for the year 2000 for all fish farmers; when the formal investigation procedure was opened, the Commission understood that this exemption applied only to aquaculture undertakings in the Atlantic coast departments from Finist√®re to Gironde, but it subsequently transpired that the measure was an additional general measure applying to all producers in mainland France and the overseas departments. #NP# (5) For the record, the Commission would point out that the measures that had been deemed compatible with the common market, about which France was informed in a letter of 11 December 2001, concerned the undertakings located in the Atlantic coast departments from Finist√®re to Gironde, and were the following: #NP# - for fish farmers: application of the agricultural disasters scheme, aid for rebuilding equipment and stocks, advances on compensation to be paid by the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF), #NP# - for fishermen: aid for rebuilding vessels and equipment lost or damaged in the storm, advances on compensation to be paid by the IOPCF, flat-rate aid for loss of revenue resulting from damage suffered during the storm. #NP# A. Measures for fish farmers in the Atlantic coast departments from Finist√®re to Gironde #NP# 1. Exemption from social security contributions for the first quarter of 2000 (or an average quarter) #NP# (6) This measure was aimed at two categories of fish farmers: those whose stocks and equipment were damaged by the storm in December 1999 and who received aid for rebuilding stocks, and those who suffered damage by pollution from oil from the Erika and received an advance on compensation to be paid by the IOPCF. #NP# (7) It was a targeted measure determined by the situation of the undertakings concerned. It was applied for one, two or three months, depending on the scale of damage suffered by the undertakings concerned. During that period, the undertakings concerned were totally exempted from social security charges. #NP# (8) Applications were examined by the compensation units set up in each of the departments concerned under the authority of the prefect, with the participation of the administrations concerned, professional organisations, banks and insurance companies. The list of beneficiaries was drawn up by the Directorate for Sea Fishing and Sea-based Fish Farming at the proposal of the departments‚Äô prefects. It concerned 1476 undertakings. The total value of the exemptions was EUR 0.87 million. #NP# 2. Reduction of financial charges #NP# (9) This measure was applied to the same undertakings as those referred to in recitals 6 to 8. It consisted in paying, under individual debt adjustment plans, part of the interest falling due in 2000, 2001 and 2002 for medium and long-term loans and operational consolidation loans. The purpose of these measures stated by France in its letter of 13 August 2001 was to reduce the financial pressure on undertakings affected by the storm and/or the oil pollution. #NP# (10) Application files had to be submitted by 1 April 2000. They were evaluated by the departments‚Äô maritime affairs directorates and presented to the compensation unit. The amount of the aid was determined according to criteria defined locally. The compensation units had to consider the scale of activity actually lost in the 1999/2000 winter, the debt situation and vulnerability of the undertaking, the operating revenue for the last two financial years, any external revenue to the undertaking over the same period, and the viability of the undertaking. The undertakings‚Äô creditors (banks and suppliers) were asked to make a particular effort. The amount of the aid could not exceed FRF 48000 (EUR 7317), except where the compensation unit judged the situation particularly critical and raised the ceiling to FRF 62000 (EUR 9451). #NP# (11) The individual debt adjustment plans drawn up under this procedure were the basis for an agreement approved by all the parties and identifying the contribution of each party to its implementation. The decision to award the aid was taken by the department prefect. The total amount of the aid was approximately FRF 8 million (EUR 1,2 million) for 1083 undertakings. #NP# B. Additional measures #NP# (12) In addition to the above measures ‚Äî both those for which the formal investigation procedure was initiated and those which the Commission has already approved ‚Äî the Minister for agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture decided to apply additional measures to assist these undertakings, in order, as France has stated, to deal with the difficulties facing the fisheries and aquaculture sector as a result of the cumulative effects of the storm and oil pollution, and take account of the damage suffered by undertakings in the sector because of the deterioration of the market. #NP# 1. Exemption of all fish farmers from State fees for the year 2000 #NP# (13) As France stated in its letter of 21 June 2000, i.e. before the formal investigation procedure was initiated, an exemption from State fees for fish farming concessions in public sea waters and water intake authorisations to supply parcels situated on private property was granted for the year 2000. #NP# (14) In its letter of 5 March 2002, in which it gave its comments on the initiation of the procedure, France stated that this measure was part of the additional relief measures for all fish farmers in mainland France and the overseas departments. #NP# (15) In response to a request from the Commission, France confirmed in its letter of 24 September 2002 that this exemption had been extended to all marine fish farmers by a decision of 12 September 2000. #NP# (16) The total value of the exemption was EUR 3,81 million. #NP# 2. Reduction of social security contributions for fish farmers and fishermen #NP# (17) The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries decided (decisions issued in circulars of 15 April 2000 and 13 July 2000) to grant all undertakings in the sector a 50 % reduction in social security contributions for the period 15 April 2000 to 15 July 2000 for fish farmers and 15 April 2000 to 15 October 2000 for fishermen. #NP# (18) This reduction applied to employers‚Äô and employees‚Äô contributions for all fishermen and fish farmers in mainland France and the overseas departments. #NP# (19) The procedures for applying the reduction varied according to whether the contributions were paid to the ENIM (Etablissement National des Invalides de la Marine) or the MSA (Mutualit√© Sociale Agricole). #NP# (20) The rate of reduction of contributions to the ENIM was 50 % for both employees‚Äô and employers‚Äô contributions. However, in the case of certain vessels for which the share payment system is not applied, the part of the employers‚Äô contributions taken over was increased to 75 %. France explained this different rate by the fact that in the case of share payment there is a close financial solidarity between the owners and the crew in the face of difficulties encountered in the course of fishing activities, particularly as regards reduced turnover, whereas in the case of industrial ship owners where this type of payment does not exist, the owners bear the greater part of economic difficulties. #NP# (21) The procedures for the reduction of the contributions owed to the MSA for fish farmers covered by this scheme were defined in a circular issued by the Ministry of agriculture and fisheries on 25 April 2000. 50 % of the contributions payable by fish farmers and heads of undertakings were paid for them for three twelfths of the contributions required for 1999 and for the contributions due from them for their employees for the last three months of 1999. #NP# (22) The total value of these exemptions was FRF 119 million (EUR 18,2 million). #NP# C. Reasons for initiating the formal investigation procedure #NP# (23) The measures described in sections A and B were adopted in response to the pollution caused by the wreck of the petrol tanker Erika on 12 December 1999 and the violent storm of 26 and 27 December 1999. #NP# (24) They were analysed in the light of Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty, which states that aid is compatible with the common market if it is granted ""to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences."" The pollution following the shipwreck of the Erika can be described as an exceptional occurrence within the meaning of this Article. Equally, the extreme and unaccustomed violence of the storm of 26 and 27 December 1999 qualifies it to be described as a natural disaster. #NP# (25) The Commission‚Äôs role in this context is to establish whether there was over-compensation for the damage caused by these events. #NP# 1. Measures for fish farmers in the Atlantic coast departments from Finist√®re to Gironde #NP# (26) The measures for which the formal investigation procedure was initiated are the exemption from social security contributions for the first quarter of 2000 (or an average quarter), the reduction in financial charges and the exemption from State fees. #NP# (27) The social security contributions exemption measure was applied after examination by the compensation unit of the situation of each undertaking that might qualify for it. The duration of the exemption was graded, from one to three months, depending on the damage suffered. This exemption measure was additional to other measures (application of the agricultural disaster scheme, aid for rebuilding equipment and stock and advances on compensation to be paid by the IOPCF). On the basis of the information provided, the Commission did not feel able to confirm that this exemption from social security contributions had not, overall, involved compensation over and above the damage suffered. #NP# (28) The reduction of financial charges was also additional to the other measures adopted. Here too, the Commission could not be sure that this measure had not provided compensation over and above the damage suffered. #NP# (29) The exemption from State fees was also additional to the other measures adopted. Also, according to the information available to the Commission, all fish farmers in the six departments concerned appeared to have benefited from this measure. France did not state the reasons why this measure had been extended to all those working in the sector in these departments. Therefore the Commission again could not be sure that, overall, the exemption from State fees had not provided compensation over and above the damage suffered. #NP# (30) Since the Commission could not establish that there had not been over-compensation for the damage suffered, these measures could not be declared compatible with the common market under Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty. #NP# (31) As unnotified aid, these measures were analysed in the light of the Guidelines on the examination of State aid to fisheries and aquaculture [2], adopted in 1997 and in force at the time of the measures (hereinafter the 1997 Guidelines). Since the aid concerned was operating aid, the Commission applied the third indent of the fourth subparagraph of point 1.2 of the 1997 Guidelines, which states as a general principle that operating aid is incompatible with the common market. It found that on the basis of the information available it still had doubts about the compatibility of the measures with the common market. #NP# 2. Additional measures reducing social security contributions for all fish farmers and fishermen #NP# (32) According to France, the additional relief measures for all fish farmers and fishermen in mainland France and the overseas departments were adopted to compensate for the adverse economic impact on the sector of the deterioration of the market caused by the poor image of fisheries and aquaculture products following the pollution caused by the wreck of the Erika. #NP# Fish farmers #NP# (33) Social security contributions were reduced for the period 15 April to 15 July 2000. #NP# (34) According to France, the deterioration of the market led to a fall in retail sales (9 % by volume and 5 % by weight) of shellfish in the first half of 2000. The storm also had a negative impact on the economic situation of the entire shellfish industry as Charente-Maritime plays a key role in the marketing of oysters in France. #NP# (35) However, France gave no information on the link between the amount of economic damage which it stated that the oil pollution had caused to all shellfish producers and the amount represented by the exemption from social security contributions over the period in question. The Commission was not therefore able to establish that the exemption measure corresponded in value to the damage suffered and did not over-compensate. #NP# (36) Since the measure had the characteristics of operating aid, the Commission found, on the basis of the third indent of the fourth subparagraph of point 1.2 of the 1997 Guidelines that, on the basis of the information at its disposal, there were doubts as to the compatibility of the measure with the common market. #NP# Fishermen #NP# (37) Social security contributions were reduced for the period from 15 April to 15 October 2000. #NP# (38) According to France there was a general downturn in the market for fisheries products, with a sustained fall in demand because of consumers‚Äô concerns about the health implications of the oil pollution. #NP# (39) Various retail sales statistics on fisheries products were provided by France in justification of this relief measure. The Commission took note of this information. However, in its letter informing France that the formal investigation procedure was being initiated, the Commission pointed out that other information indicated that during the first quarter of 2000 the value of auction sales rose by 3 % against the previous year and market withdrawals were less than 1,5 % of the quantities landed for all the main species, which was equivalent to the withdrawal rate in the same period in 1999. Furthermore, the exemption measure was applied to all French fisheries undertakings, included those established in the overseas departments. #NP# (40) Moreover, the Commission had taken note of information distributed by Agence France-Presse and in the newspapers according to which the reductions in social security contributions were intended to compensate the rise in oil prices which had already been registered for several months. #NP# (41) In view of all this information, the Commission found that France had not provided information establishing that the measure was compensation for the economic impact on undertakings of the deterioration of the market in fisheries and aquaculture products. Since the measure had the characteristics of operating aid, the Commission found, on the basis of the third indent of the fourth subparagraph of point 1.2 of the 1997 Guidelines that, on the basis of the information at its disposal, there were serious doubts as to the compatibility of the measure with the common market. #NP# III. COMMENTS FROM FRANCE #NP# A. Measures for fish farmers in the Atlantic coast departments from Finist√®re to Gironde #NP# (42) France stated that the purpose of the reductions in financial charges granted under debt adjustment plans was to help the most vulnerable undertakings to deal with an exceptional situation associated with the natural disasters, and not to cover losses. Only the most vulnerable undertakings were eligible for this measure. #NP# (43) France stated that the procedure put in place for the reduction of social security contributions and financial charges was precisely to avoid over-compensation for damage suffered. The compensation units set up in the departments affected evaluated the overall economic situation of each undertaking and validated the amounts granted in line with the damage suffered. #NP# B. Additional measures for all fish farmers and fishermen #NP# 1. Measures for fish farmers #NP# (44) France found that relief restricted to the fish farmers affected by the storm and the oil pollution was inadequate. The overall situation of the industry appeared sufficiently worrying to justify intervention for the industry as a whole. The media impact of the oil pollution on public opinion damaged the consumer image of fisheries and aquaculture products, and particularly farmed shellfish, whatever their origin. A study carried out for the Office national interprofessionnel des produits de la mer et de l‚Äôaquaculture (National Inter-trade Board for Sea and Fish-Farming Products - Ofimer), estimated that shellfish farming turnover fell by FRF 51 million (EUR 7,77 million) over a four-month period from 17 December 1999 to 16 April 2000. #NP# (45) General measures were adopted to deal with this situation: a general reduction of social security contributions and exemption from State fees. The aid value of the social security contribution reductions was EUR 3,35 million. The value of the State fees exemption was EUR 3,81 million. The total amount was thus less than the EUR 7,77 million fall in turnover estimated by the study carried out for Ofimer. #NP# 2. Measures for fishermen #NP# (46) France contests the Commission‚Äôs grounds for initiating the formal investigation procedure. It states that the shock of the Erika oil pollution, and media coverage of its alleged or suspected consequences badly damaged the image of fisheries and aquaculture products; not a single sector or area escaped this effect. #NP# (47) France further states that the relief period ( 15 April to 15 October 2000) in fact relates to fishing activity in the first six months of the year, since social security contributions actually relate to the activity of the three previous months. This lag made it possible to take into consideration the exact activity of fishermen when the greatest difficulties were experienced, i.e. over the six months following the two disasters of December 1999. France therefore considers that the Commission‚Äôs analysis should not have referred to the Ofimer Flash Eco memo on the economy of 16 February 2001. #NP# (48) It also considers that the Commission should not have referred to the Ofimer memo on the economy for January to April 2000 since it was based on estimates and a large part of the data for March and April was estimated. The discrepancies found by the Commission were not the result of different evaluations but of the normal statistical gap between raw instantaneous data and its definitive validation. The Commission should therefore have confined its analysis to the data in the memo of 6 April 2001 sent to the Commission by the France as part of the investigation of this case, this data being definitive for the period in question. #NP# (49) France also states that Ofimer‚Äôs monthly summaries indicate that the quantities landed over the first six months were stable in relation to the same period in 1999, although there were downturns, sometimes large-scale, over short periods which appear to correspond to the periods of greatest media coverage. However, during this period withdrawals increased by 28 % as against 1999, particularly during the first three months of the year (January: + 92 %, February: + 66 %, March: + 35 %). For some species the level of withdrawals was extremely high (Norway lobsters: + 175 %, monkfish: + 161 %, spider crab: √ó 5), which is evidence of the psychological impact of the oil pollution on consumer behaviour. #NP# (50) During the first half of 2000, since the quantities landed were relatively stable but there was a very substantial increase in the quantities withdrawn, the quantities sold decreased. The consumption of fresh fisheries and aquaculture products fell by 7 % (6 % for fish, 9 % for shellfish and 6,5 % for crustaceans, particularly shrimps). #NP# (51) Prices fell by 6 % against January 1999 and this decline persisted for the species essential to undertakings‚Äô equilibrium. It was found that of the 49 important species monitored by Ofimer, prices fell for 34 species in January 2000, 26 in February 2000 and 21 in March 2000. Similarly, a constant decline was recorded for all the main species fished over the entire period. #NP# (52) France further states that consumers could not easily distinguish the origin of fisheries and aquaculture products and disaffection with those products was manifested irrespective of the production area. The suspicion generated by the oil pollution therefore affected products both from the mainland and from the overseas departments without differentiation. According to France, the customs data for the overseas departments shows that their products also suffered the effects of the oil pollution and there was therefore no reason to exclude them from the support provided by the Government. #NP# (53) Lastly, France commented that the Commission had given little credit to the press articles submitted for illustrative purposes and yet had made much of the views journalists had garnered at trade fairs. It submitted with its comments a number of articles and additional documents showing the media hype that surrounded this event and the climate of suspicion that gave rise to consumer disaffection with fisheries and aquaculture products. It also refuted the Commission‚Äôs suggestion in its letter notifying initiation of the formal investigation procedure that the reduction in social security contributions was really intended to compensate for the increase in fuel prices, which had already been registered for several months. #NP# IV. ASSESSMENT #NP# A. Existence of State aid #NP# (54) Article 87(1) of the Treaty stipulates that ""any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market."" #NP# (55) The various measures that are the subject of this Decision (reductions in social security contributions and financial charges, exemption from State fees) are measures that favour undertakings engaging in a certain activity, namely aquaculture or fisheries. These undertakings are relieved of certain charges which they would normally have to bear. #NP# (56) The measures entailed a loss of State resources, either directly (reduction in financial charges and exemption from State fees) or indirectly, since the State had to compensate the losses borne by the body levying the social security contributions. These measures therefore constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty. #NP# (57) Furthermore, since the products of the beneficiary undertakings are sold on the Community market, the measures adopted by France reinforce the position of those undertakings both on the French market in relation to undertakings from other Member States wishing to introduce their own products (fisheries and aquaculture products or other competing food products) on that market and on the markets of other Member States in relation to the undertakings active on those markets (for the same products). The measures therefore distort or threaten to distort competition and may affect trade between the Member States. #NP# (58) Such measures are in principle prohibited under Article 87(1) of the Treaty. They may only be deemed compatible with the common market if they qualify for one of the derogations provided for in the Treaty. The aid to aquaculture and fisheries undertakings must be analysed in the light of the 1997 Guidelines, as was done in the course of the preliminary investigation. #NP# B. Measures for fish farmers in the Atlantic coast departments from Finist√®re to Gironde #NP# (59) The Commission initiated the formal investigation procedure for certain measures adopted to assist fish farmers after the events of December 1999 because it had not been able to establish that overall, with the cumulative effect of the different aid measures, including those which it had already approved, there had not been over-compensation for the damage suffered. #NP# (60) The formal investigation procedure related to the following aid measures: #NP# - exemption from social security contributions during the first quarter of 2000 (for one, two, or three months according to the damage suffered), #NP# - reduction of financial charges for fish farmers directly affected by the storm or the oil pollution, #NP# - exemption from State fees for the year 2000 for concessions in the six departments affected by the events (Atlantic coast departments from Finist√®re to Gironde). #NP# (61) Going by the additional information provided, in the case of the exemption from social security contributions and the reduction of financial charges, the procedure set up by France, with the creation of a compensation unit in each department concerned, with representatives of the State services concerned, banking establishments and professionals, really was designed to avoid risks of over-compensation. France points out that investigating each case individually ensured that the aid was adjusted to the situation of each undertaking, thereby avoiding over-compensation. #NP# (62) In view of this information the Commission finds that France established an appropriate procedure allowing over-compensation to be avoided. It therefore finds that the only objective of this aid was indeed to compensate for damage suffered as a result of the two exceptional occurrences, the storm of December 1999 and the wreck of the Erika. #NP# (63) The exemption from social-security contributions and the reduction of financial charges must therefore be deemed compatible with the common market under Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty. #NP# (64) The exemption from State fees will be analysed in section C.1 below, since the measure was applied to all French fish-farmers, contrary to the information at the Commission‚Äôs disposal prior to initiation of the formal investigation procedure. France informed the Commission in its letter of 21 June 2000 that the marine aquaculture concessions and the water intake authorisations in the departments concerned were exempt from payment of the State fee for the year 2000. Since France made no further mention of this exemption in its subsequent letters to the Commission, which described in detail the content of the measures implemented, the Commission asked France by letter of 21 June 2001 whether the exemption had in fact been applied, and if so asked France to supply the relevant information. In its reply of 13 August 2001 France stated that the fish farmers of the departments of Finist√®re, Morbihan, Loire-Atlantique, Vend√©e, Charente-Maritime and Gironde had in fact been granted exemption from the State fee payable in 2000, without mentioning that these departments were not the only ones to which the exemption had been applied. Not until it responded to the initiation of the formal investigation procedure did France state that the measure was a general one applying to all French fish farmers, like the reduction in social security contributions. #NP# C. Additional measures in favour of all fish farmers and all fishermen #NP# 1. Fish farmers #NP# (65) The exemption from State fees for the year 2000 and the reduction in social security charges from 15 April to 15 July 2000 were applied to all fish farmers of mainland France and the overseas departments. #NP# (66) According to France these measures were introduced to compensate for the loss of turnover suffered by the whole industry throughout the territory as a result of the deterioration of the consumer image of farmed shellfish after the wreck of the Erika. A study carried out for the Ofimer concluded that, following this event, turnover had fallen by EUR 7,7 million against the previous year. #NP# (67) The exemption from State fees, with a value of EUR 3,81 million, and the reduction in social security charges, with a value of EUR 3,35 million, would thus partially compensate for this loss of revenue. The total value of the aid for all France was thus EUR 7,16 million, less than the estimated loss (EUR 7,7 million). #NP# (68) On the basis of the information provided the Commission does not contest that the farmed shellfish market suffered temporarily. However, as already noted in the Commission decision initiating the formal investigation procedure, this market deterioration must be put in perspective ‚Äî there was no sudden and extreme customer disaffection. #NP# (69) The Commission notes that in 1999 the value of aquaculture products (shellfish and fish) for the whole of France was EUR 502 million (2000 Ofimer report). The table giving this figure does not indicate the relative shares of fish and shellfish. According to another source (""aquaculture"" page of the website of the Ministry of Agriculture ( [3]), the value of farmed fish products (sea farming and freshwater farming) was EUR 221 million. This would make the estimated value of shellfish farming EUR 281 million. #NP# (70) The loss of turnover following the deterioration of the image of shellfish can therefore be estimated as 7,7/281 or 2,7 % of the value of the previous year‚Äôs production. The compensation of a value of EUR 7,16 million would therefore be 7,16/281 or 2,5 % of turnover. #NP# (71) The Commission considers that small-scale losses must be categorised as costs to be borne by undertakings in the normal course of their activity. Any economic activity is subject to various greater and lesser risks (price fluctuation of production factors, fluctuation of the sales price of production, possible increase in charges, etc.) resulting from a wide variety of unforeseen circumstances. It considers that when such risks lead to small-scale losses they cannot give rise to an entitlement to compensation because that would mean that traders could claim compensation whenever they suffered the impact of any unforeseen event. For example, in line with this general approach, the Commission considers that in the agriculture sector losses must exceed a threshold of 30 % (20 % in less-favoured areas) for aid to be deemed compatible with the common market under Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty. #NP# (72) The social security contribution reduction and State fee exemption measures, intended to compensate for a loss of turnover of only 2,7 % cannot therefore in principle be deemed compatible with the common market under Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty. Nor do these aid measures correspond to any of the derogations provided for in the 1997 guidelines. They must therefore in principle be deemed incompatible with the common market. #NP# (73) However, the Commission notes that the measures applied to fish farmers in the Atlantic coast departments from Finist√®re to Gironde were intended to compensate for damage directly linked to one of the events of December 1999, the wreck of the Erika or the storm. These aid measures must be evaluated in conjunction with the other aid measures granted following those events. The Commission has already pronounced those other aid measures (application of the agricultural disasters scheme, aid for rebuilding equipment and stock, advances on the compensation to be paid by the IOPCF) compatible with the common market (letter of 11 December 2001), or is pronouncing them so in this decision (social security contributions relief for the first quarter of 2000 and reduction of financial charges ‚Äî see Section B). #NP# (74) Since these measures have been or are now being pronounced compatible with the common market under Article 87(2)(b), an additional compensation worth 2,5 % of turnover must be incorporated in the total aid received by the fish farmers (the percentage of 2,5 %, corresponding to EUR 7,16 million/EUR 281 million, was calculated for France as a whole; the same percentage may be taken as the average for each farm). Given this low relative value and the fact that the other aid did not fully compensate for the damage suffered, the risk of over-compensation is avoided. #NP# (75) Losses, and aid allocations to compensate for them, should have been assessed for each individual aquaculture holding to establish whether the value of damage suffered by each undertaking (with the addition of the loss of turnover resulting from the deterioration in the image of shellfish, estimated at 2,7 %) was significant. This was not the method France adopted, since the scheme applied to all producers in the area concerned (Atlantic coast departments from Finist√®re to Gironde). However, in this case the Commission finds France‚Äôs method acceptable and considers that it was reasonable to use it to facilitate administration, given the large area and the number of undertakings affected by the events. #NP# (76) Therefore the State fee exemption and social security relief cannot be deemed compatible with the common market under Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty when applied to the aquaculture holdings outside the departments affected by the events. They can however be deemed compatible with the common market when applied to the undertakings in the Atlantic coast departments from Finist√®re to Gironde. #NP# 2. Fishermen #NP# (77) The nationwide social security contribution relief applied to French fisherman was, according to France, intended to compensate for the depressed market for fisheries products. The relief was for the period 15 April to 15 October 2000. #NP# Data used by the Commission #NP# (78) The Commission was not convinced by the data submitted by France, particularly in view of other information derived from Ofimer (information on the website of this public institution [4]), and decided to initiate a formal investigation procedure. #NP# (79) In a memo of 5 March 2002 responding to the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, France stated that the information provided in its memo of 5 April 2001 was the definitive data for the period concerned. It considered that the Commission should not have based its assessment on information found on the Ofimer website. #NP# (80) The Commission rejects this argument. Ofimer is a public institution answerable to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and one of its functions is, as the notice on its website states, the daily monitoring of developments on the fisheries and aquaculture market. For this purpose it has an economic observatory. The fish-auction network gathers sales data from all the French auctions in order to pass it on in summary form to the industry‚Äôs operators. It was in just such summary data that the Commission was interested, since they allowed the partial data provided by France to be placed in their general context for the purposes of analysing the aid scheme. #NP# (81) The Commission cannot accept that the Ofimer data differs significantly from the definitive data established some time later. The methodology used by the Ofimer economic observatory to gather this information is described in the institution‚Äôs annual reports [5]. On the basis of the fish-auction network‚Äôs contributions, Ofimer sends local operators (auctions, producers‚Äô organisations, wholesale traders) a daily memo and a weekly memo publishing quantity and price data for the main auctions and the most representative species of French supply. In addition, at the beginning of each month an ""advance"" memo gives the accumulated sales data from the beginning of the year for the most representative auctions and the main species and at the end of each quarter a summary memo on sales is drawn up and made available on the institution‚Äôs website. The method of collecting this information shows that Ofimer data is reliable. There is no concrete evidence that this data is misleading. Furthermore, the Commission has found nothing in the documents it has consulted on the website to correct or contradict the data it has used. Had it done so it would naturally have taken this into account. Further more by making this data available to the public on its website, Ofimer gives the data official status. There is no reason to doubt its credibility. #NP# (82) The information that France officially submitted, before the investigation procedure was initiated and in its memo of 5 March responding to the initiation of the procedure, was too partial and incomplete for the Commission to correctly assess the state of the market for fisheries products over the period concerned. It had to find other information in order to carry out its assessment. The Commission regrets that France did not send this data, or official data of the same kind, to the Commission directly. #NP# (83) The available data should therefore be analysed to determine the exact situation of the market in fisheries products during the first half of 2000. #NP# Supplies #NP# (84) The memo from France of 6 April 2001 did not contain figures on supplies. It only said that ""the quantities actually sold and the value of those qualities were in reality lower than the data held by the Commission (indicate) and lower than in 1999."" On that date the Commission was already familiar with the data in the memo on the economy for January to April 2000 examined by the management board of Ofimer at its meeting of 24 May 2000, and it referred to this data in its request to France for additional information of 15 January 2001 (quoting an extract stating that ""the quantities landed during the first four months of 2000 are stable compared to the same period in 1999 and the value of auction sales has increased by 3 % compared to last year."") #NP# (85) The memo from France of 5 March 2002, on the other hand, says that ""for all the main French auctions, ‚Ä¶ the quantities landed in the first six months of 2000 were stable compared to the same period in 1999, although there were downturns, sometimes major ones, over short periods, apparently corresponding to the greatest media activity."" This corresponds to what is said in the memo on the economy referred to and to Ofimer‚Äôs Flash Eco of 16 February 2001, to which the Commission referred in its decision initiating the procedure (this document provides important information comparing production in 2000 with that in 1999 and stating that ""the results for 2000 show sales and volume stability compared with 1999.""). #NP# (86) The Commission therefore notes that supplies remained stable in 2000, and in particular during the first six months. There is no information to indicate that there was a downturn in supplies when media coverage was most intense. The downturns in supplies were more probably the result of other factors, mainly bad weather. It is not rare for a large proportion of fishing vessels to be unable to go to sea over relatively long periods (one to two weeks or more) in cases of persistent bad weather. The media influence cited does not have a direct impact on supplies ‚Äî it does not prevent fishermen from going to sea. Its impact is, rather, to be observed at the next stage, on prices and quantities withdrawn from the market. #NP# Quantities withdrawn #NP# (87) According to the French memo of 6 April 2001, ""the withdrawal rate was much higher in the early part of 2000 than in the same period of the previous year: there was a rise of 25 % between January to April 1999 and January to April 2000, 35 % between January to March 1999 and January to March 2000, 92 % between January 1999 and January 2000 and 57 % between February 1999 and February 2000."" The memo of 5 March 2002 also quotes these figures, adding that for the period January to May withdrawals rose by 32 % and for the period January to June by 28 %. It went on: ""the level of withdrawals showed some very sharp peaks for species such as Norway lobster (175 %), monkfish (161 %) and spider crab (X 5) whose sensitivity to residual hydrocarbons [6] was highly publicised."" #NP# (88) This data is incomplete and does not give a full picture of withdrawals. The quantities actually withdrawn are not given, so a doubling or tripling of the quantity would be insignificant if the reference quantity, namely the quantity withdrawn in the first year, was very small. Nor are there any figures for the quantities withdrawn from the market as a proportion of the quantities landed. Nor is it explained whether the increased withdrawals in January were of species whose sensitivity to hydrocarbons received the greatest publicity. The Commission will analyse the arguments concerning three species cited by France: Norway lobster, monkfish and spider crab. #NP# (89) A study carried out by Ofimer on Norway lobster [7] reports that the peak production season for this species is from mid-April to August. Sizeable withdrawals may be seasonally determined. The study cites the case of abnormally high withdrawals in May and June 2001 as a result of large-scale supplies of live Norway lobster at a time of year in which they are harder to sell. Furthermore, according to information received by the Commission in the course of administering the rules governing common organisation of the market in fishery products (Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 of 17 December 1992 on the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products and the implementing Regulations [8] applicable on the date of the events in question), these withdrawals for the first half of 2000 stood at 21 kg in January, 5 kg in February, 2 kg in March, 103 kg in April, 1364 kg in May and 2007 kg in June. So there is no conclusive data to show that the publicity surrounding the oil spill ‚Äî which one supposes would be at its greatest in the weeks immediately after the accident ‚Äî led to a significant increase in the quantity of Norway lobster withdrawn from the market. #NP# (90) According to the figures in the Commission‚Äôs possession, 454 kg of monkfish were withdrawn from sale in January 2000 against 84 kg in January 1999, which is a marked increase. However, withdrawals in February 2000 stood at only 59 kg against 221 kg in February 1999, and at 39 kg in March 2000 against 148 kg in March 1999; withdrawals in the following three months were again below 1999 levels (241 kg against 278 kg). The Commission cannot conclude from this conflicting evidence that the oil spill led to an increase in withdrawals. #NP# (91) The Commission has no data concerning the quantities withdrawn of spider crab, the third species cited by France [9]. We can, however, look at the quantities notified to the Commission for crabs of the species Cancer pagurus, which are distributed and marketed in a similar way. The quantities withdrawn rose in the first months of 2000 in relation to 1999, but, in absolute terms, the quantities were small: a rise from 19 to 47 kg in January, 3 to 35 kg in February, 7 to 31 kg in March, none in April, and then from 31 to 164 kg in May and from 501 to 521 kg in June. So consumers did not shun the Cancer pagurus crab in the early months of 2000, and nothing indicates that things were any different for the spider crab over the same period. #NP# (92) Therefore, although withdrawals in January 2000 rose by 92 % compared with January 1999 and rose by 28 % over the first half of that year, these withdrawals were not large in absolute terms. Nor is there any evidence to link this increase to the media coverage of the oil spill. Furthermore, the figures available to the Commission show that the large withdrawals recorded in January 2000 were of species such as spotted dogfish (from 11423 to 16362 kg), saithe (from 120 to 3727 kg) and plaice (from 51 to 1789 kg), species for which, given the way they are marketed, there is little or no link between increased withdrawals and the media coverage of the oil spill. And, according to Ofimer‚Äôs sectoral report for January-April 2000, withdrawals remained below 1,5 % of the quantities landed of the main species; individual withdrawals were reported for sea bass, anchovy and spider crab. #NP# (93) To sum up, the Commission finds that there is no evidence to link increased withdrawals to media coverage of the oil spill. #NP# Quantities sold and prices #NP# (94) In its memo of 6 April 2001 France reported that retail sales of fishery products were down 2 % in volume over the first half compared with the previous year, with fresh products particularly affected, down 7 % in volume and 1 % in value, breaking down into a 6 % volume drop for shellfish and 6 % for fish (5 % for fish pieces and 7 % for whole fish). The memo of 5 March 2002 cites these figures (with a minor correction to 6,5 % for shellfish) as evidence that consumers were boycotting fishery products. It also states that, of 49 major species monitored by OFIMER, prices had fallen for 34 in January, 26 in January-February, 21 in January-March and 18 in January-June. Average price falls for some of these species were: sole (‚Äì 5 %), sea bass (‚Äì 6 %), hake (‚Äì 6 %), anchovy (‚Äì 6 %), squid (‚Äì 11 %), saithe (‚Äì 8 %), sardine (‚Äì 6 %), John Dory (‚Äì 11 %), mackerel (‚Äì 18 %), plaice (‚Äì 28 %), black scabbard-fish (‚Äì 20 %), black sea bream (‚Äì 11 %), red gurnard (‚Äì 4 %), octopus (‚Äì 23 %), spider crab (‚Äì 16 %), pink shrimp (‚Äì 20 %). According to France, ""all this data is quantifiable evidence of the slump in the market between January and June 2000 and shows, if proof were needed, the impact the wreck of the Erika had on consumers‚Äô behaviour."" #NP# (95) The Commission notes that this data is not really quantifiable evidence of what happened. To give a true picture of the situation France should also have sent the Commission figures for the quantities marketed of each of the species in question, something it did not do. #NP# (96) The Commission points out that price trends were inconsistent according to Ofimer‚Äôs sectoral report for January to April 2000. Some prices fell as a result of plentiful supply (sea bass down 11 %, saithe down 8 % and hake down 9 %) whereas limited supplies led to price hikes for other species: red mullet (31 %), cod (27 %) and monkfish (13 %). This sectoral report also shows a change in the structure of supply, with expensive species (hake, monkfish, sole, sea bass, red mullet, Norway lobster) gaining market share from cheaper species (mackerel, saithe, whiting, cuttlefish, anchovies) and leading to a 3 % increase in the value of auction sales on the previous year. #NP# (97) The value of auction sales minus sales costs represents vessels‚Äô turnover. The Commission therefore observes a slight increase in the overall turnover of fishing businesses. Accordingly, though prices for many species did fall, this fall did not reflect a decline in prices across the board but the contrasting situation described by Ofimer in its sectoral report. Though the oil spill may well have affected the market for fishery products, e.g. for certain specific species, evidence from a number of sources suggests that the impact was very marginal. Furthermore, if it had been significant, Ofimer would definitely have mentioned it in the various public documents it drew up. #NP# Conclusion #NP# (98) On the basis of the evidence, the Commission believes that the nationwide reduction of social security contributions granted to fishermen for the period 15 April to 15 October cannot be considered compatible with the common market under Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty. #NP# (99) As operating aid granted to all fishing businesses without any obligation on the part of the recipients, this aid is incompatible with the common market by virtue of the third indent of the fourth paragraph of section 1.2 of the 1997 Guidelines. #NP# V. CONCLUSIONS #NP# (100) The Commission finds that France has unlawfully implemented the aid in question contrary to Article 88(3) of the Treaty. #NP# (101) On the basis of the arguments set out in sections IV-B and IV-C.1 of this Decision, the Commission believes that the aid given to fish farmers in the departments concerned (reduction of social security contributions and of financial charges and exemption from State fees) is compatible with the common market under Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty. #NP# (102) On the basis of the arguments set out in section IV-C.1 of this Decision, the Commission believes that the reduction of social security contributions for aquaculture producers for the period 15 April to 15 July 2000 and the exemption from State fees for the year 2000 granted to fish farmers in other departments are not eligible for the derogation provided for in Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty. #NP# (103) On the basis of the arguments set out in section IV-C.2 of this Decision, the Commission believes that the reduction of social security contributions granted to fishermen for the period from 15 April to 15 October 2000 is not eligible for the derogation provided for in Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty, #NP# HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: #NP# Article 1 #NP# The reduction of social security contributions, reduction of financial charges and exemption from State fees granted by France to fish farmers in the departments of Finist√®re, Morbihan, Loire-Atlantique, Vend√©e, Charente-Maritime and Gironde are compatible with the common market. #NP# Article 2 #NP# The aid granted by France to fish farmers of departments other than Finist√®re, Morbihan, Loire-Atlantique, Vend√©e, Charente-Maritime and Gironde in the form of a reduction of social security contributions for the period 15 April to 15 July 2000 and exemption from State fees for the year 2000 is incompatible with the common market. #NP# Article 3 #NP# The aid granted by France to fishermen in the form of a reduction of social security contributions for the period 15 April to 15 October 2000 is incompatible with the common market. #NP# Article 4 #NP# 1.

The Commission was surprised to find that the test results were obtained from fish samples taken, in the case of three tests, on 22 February 2000 and received by the laboratory on 23 February 2000, in the case of another two tests, taken on 7 March 2000 and received by the laboratory on 10 March, and in the nine remaining cases taken and tested in September and October 2000. These tests showing the presence of hydrocarbons in the flesh do not prove that they came from the Erika, given the amount of time that had elapsed. To prove cause and effect between the Erika‚Äôs oil and hydrocarbon contamination, tests should have been carried out closer to the date of the wreck. The lack of such tests would lead to the conclusion that there was not any real organoleptic contamination immediately after the event. The presence of hydrocarbons three or nine months later may in some cases ‚Äì those of February and March for example, be just as easily attributable, not to the Erika, but to the residues from the cleaning of tanks that ships often carry out in the open sea in breach of the rules. This alternative possibility is all the more probable for the samples taken in September and October. #NP# [7] ""The Norway lobster market"" presented to the Ofimer board on 6 March 2002. #NP# [8] OJ L 388, 31.12.1992, p. 1.

Introduction #NP# 1.1 The MODINIS programme [1] was established pursuant to the objectives of the Lisbon Council of 23/ 24 March 2000 (making the EU the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world) and of the Feira Council of 19/ 20 June 2000, which adopted the eEurope action plan and the long-term perspectives for the knowledge-based economy encouraging the access of all citizens to new information and communication technologies (ICTs). #NP# 1.2 MODINIS is a multi-annual programme financing the Information Society (IS) for the period 2003-2005 with regard to monitoring of the eEurope Action Plan and is due to expire at the end of the year. The Commission proposes to extend MODINIS to cover 2006 with regard to cooperation and promotion of good practices in the field of ICTs and IS analysis using the open method of coordination (the network and information security issues which were included in the initial programme will henceforth be transferred to ENISA and no longer financed by MODINIS). #NP# 1.3 Continuity of action needs to be guaranteed between the expiry of the eEurope Action Plan at the end of 2005, the launch of the i2010 initiative in 2006 and the launch of the ICT Policy Support programme, earlier than planned, in 2007. Extending MODINIS to cover 1 January to 31 December 2006 would ensure this continuity; the estimated cost is EUR 7.72 million. A detailed work programme setting out the priorities and actions for 2006 is to be published soon. The proposal is also relevant for the EEA. #NP# 2. General comments #NP# 2.1 The Committee has repeatedly, in a number of opinions, expressed its support and encouragement for all initiatives promoting the IS, such as the eEurope Action Plan, and is soon to comment on i2010. It believes that the exchange of expertise and good practices and the establishment of indicators for IS analysis are essential and bring added value, boosting the competitiveness of the European knowledge-based economy and increasing cohesion and social inclusion, skilled employment and sustainable growth. #NP# 2.2 In particular, the Committee has already suggested that Member States be urged to introduce consultative procedures on the themes of the programme in order to address the proposals and needs expressed by users, experts and the network economy more effectively. This would also be beneficial as regards the Framework Programme which will take over from eEurope; in this connection, in-depth consultations with the social partners need to be held on qualifications and jobs in the IS. #NP# 2.3 The Committee supports the Commission's proposal to extend the MODINIS programme by a year. It would like to be informed in the very near future about the Commission's work programme for 2006. #S# Brussels, 27 October 2005. #NP# The President #NP# of the European Economic and Social Committee #NP# Anne-Marie Sigmund #NP# [1] COM(2002) 425 final ‚Äì 2002/0187 CNS; Decision No 2256/2003/EC; EESC Opinion OJ C 61 of 14.3.2003 AC ‚Äì rapporteur: Mr Retureau. #NP# -------------------------------------------------- #S# ",5188;6140;5315,32;10,3226;3231;1016,1370;2472;5442,1370;5188;2472;6140;5413;5315;5418;5442,train

PROCEDURE #NP# 1. Existing measures #NP# (1) By Regulation (EC) No 1480/2003 [2] (the original Regulation), the Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty of 34,8 % (the countervailing duty) on imports of certain electronic microcircuits known as dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung), for which a 0 % duty rate was established. #NP# (2) Two exporting producers located in the Republic of Korea cooperated in the investigation which lead to the imposition of the existing measures (the original investigation), Samsung and Hynix Semiconductor Inc., which also owns a production facility in the United States. The Community industry in the original investigation consisted of two producers which accounted for the major proportion of the total Community production of DRAMs, Infineon Technologies AG, Munich, Germany, and Micron Europe Ltd, Crowthorne, United Kingdom. #NP# 2. Grounds for the current investigation #NP# (3) In the context of the monitoring of trade defence measures, the Commission was informed that the countervailing duty in force on imports of DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea was possibly not being levied on certain imports of said DRAMs. #NP# 3. Opening of an investigation #NP# (4) On 22 March 2005, by a notice (the notice) published in the Official Journal of the European Union [3], the Commission announced the opening of an investigation with a view to determining to what extent special provisions may need to be adopted in accordance with Article 24(3) of the basic Regulation in order to ensure that the countervailing duty is correctly levied on imports of DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea. #NP# 4. Submissions #NP# (5) The Commission officially advised the authorities of the exporting country and all the parties known to be concerned of the opening of this investigation. Copies of the notice and of the non-confidential documents on the basis of which the notice was published were sent to the two exporting producers in the Republic of Korea, as well as to importers, users and to the two producers in the Community, named in the original investigation or otherwise known to the Commission. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time-limit set in the notice. #NP# (6) Submissions were received from the two exporting producers in the Republic of Korea and from the two producers and one user in the Community. Given the availability of all necessary information and data needed, it was not considered necessary to carry out verification visits at the premises of the companies that made the above submissions. #NP# B. PRODUCT CONCERNED #NP# (7) The product concerned by this investigation is the same as that covered by the original investigation, i.e. certain electronic microcircuits known as Dynamic Random Access Memories (DRAMs), of all types, densities and variations, whether assembled, in processed wafer or chips (dies), manufactured using variations of metal oxide-semiconductors (MOS) process technology, including complementary MOS types (CMOS), of all densities (including future densities), irrespective of access speed, configuration, package or frame etc., originating in the Republic of Korea. The product concerned also includes DRAMs presented in (non-customised) memory modules or (non-customised) memory boards, or in some other kind of aggregate form, provided the main purpose of which is to provide memory. #NP# (8) The product concerned is currently classifiable within CN codes 85422111, 85422113, 85422115, 85422117, ex85422101, ex85422105, ex85489010, ex84733010 and ex84735010. #NP# C. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION #NP# (9) In order to determine to what extent special provisions may need to be adopted to ensure that the countervailing duty is correctly levied, the investigation focused on the following elements: 1. the description of the product concerned and its transposition into the Combined Nomenclature (CN)/TARIC nomenclature, and 2. the anomalies resulting from the analysis of the trade flows of the product concerned imported into the Community. #NP# 1. Description of the product concerned and transposition into the CN/TARIC nomenclature #NP# (10) Article 1(1) of the original Regulation establishes that the product concerned subject to the countervailing duty is certain electronic microcircuits known as DRAMs of all types originating in the Republic of Korea. The product concerned is such regardless of the density, access speed, configuration, package or frame, etc. In addition, the manufacturing process is also mentioned (variations of metal oxide-semiconductors ‚Äî MOS-process technology, including complementary MOS types ‚Äî CMOS). #NP# (11) On the one hand, Article 1(1) of the original Regulation identifies the CN/TARIC codes under which the product concerned is classifiable. The following types of DRAMs are covered by these CN/TARIC codes: wafers, chips (dies), memories (chips mounted, i.e. with their terminals or leads, whether or not encased in ceramic, metal, plastics or other materials, hereafter referred to as ""mounted DRAMs"" and known commercially as DRAM components) and DRAM modules, memory boards and some other kind of aggregate form (hereafter referred to as multi-combinational forms of DRAMs). #NP# (12) With regard to mounted DRAMs, this type of DRAM results from the so-called ""back-end process"", that is chips which underwent an assembly (connection of the memory cell on the chip with a wire to the connectors on the outside of the capsule), testing (to check whether the encapsulated chips are functioning) and marking process. #NP# (13) On the other hand, the types of the product concerned explicitly mentioned in Article 1(1) of the original Regulation are wafers, chips (dies), assembled DRAMs (meaning mounted DRAMs and multi-combinational forms of DRAMs) and DRAMs presented in (non-customised) memory modules or memory boards or in some other kind of aggregate form (hereafter referred to as DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs incorporated in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs). #NP# (14) The above elements show that the description of the product concerned and the CN/TARIC codes are not fully in line. On the one hand, mounted DRAMs, although clearly falling within the definition of product concerned ‚Äî which includes all types of DRAMs ‚Äî and specifically mentioned in the description of the CN/TARIC codes indicated in Article 1(1) of the original Regulation, were referred to in the description of the product concerned with the ambiguous wording ""assembled"", which also refers to multi-combinational forms of DRAMs. On the other hand, DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs incorporated in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs, although explicitly mentioned in the description of the product concerned, were not specifically mentioned in the description of any of the CN/TARIC codes indicated in Article 1(1) of the original Regulation. Indeed, the latter either specifically mention DRAMs in multi-combinational forms or the chips and mounted DRAMs imported as such ‚Äî and, as a consequence, the countervailing duty has not been levied so far on this type of DRAMs. #NP# (15) With regard to mounted DRAMs, these are distinct both from DRAM chips and from multi-combinational forms of DRAMs. Consequently, for the sake of coherence and legal certainty, it appears appropriate that the product description makes explicit reference thereto. #NP# (16) With respect to DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs incorporated in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs, the fact that these are not specifically mentioned by any of the CN/TARIC codes becomes relevant in situations where multi-combinational forms of DRAMs are not originating in the Republic of Korea and are therefore not subject to the countervailing duty when imported into the Community, despite the fact that they incorporate DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs of Korean origin. #NP# (17) Indeed, in line with the constant practice within the EU Member States to use the EC negotiating position in the WTO Harmonisation Working Programme as the basis for the interpretation of Article 24 of the Community Customs Code [4], the non-preferential rules of origin applicable in the Community to multi-combinational forms of DRAMs, falling within CN codes ex84733010, ex84735010, and ex85489010, establish that the country of origin shall be the last country of manufacture where the increase in value acquired as a result of working and processing, and if applicable, the incorporation of parts originating in that country, represent at least 45 % of the ex-works price of the multi-combinational form of DRAMs. In case this rule is not satisfied, DRAMs are considered to be originating in the country in which the major portion of the materials used originated. #NP# (18) The documents and pieces of evidence submitted during the investigation enabled to conclude that multi-combinational forms of DRAMs of non-Korean origin could incorporate DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs of Korean origin. Three types of evidences allowed to draw the above conclusion. First of all, prima facie evidence was submitted showing that some multi-combinational forms of DRAMs declared as originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea incorporated mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by companies subject to the countervailing duty. Secondly, Binding Origin Information issued in 2003 concerned multi-combinational forms of DRAMs falling within CN code ex85489010 (TARIC code 85489010*10), which were manufactured partly in the United States of America and partly in the Republic of Korea. Finally, two press articles were submitted, in which reference was made to the fact that non-preferential rules of origin applicable in the Community allowed Korean companies to export to the Community DRAM chips or mounted DRAMs manufactured by Korean companies subject to the countervailing duty, by incorporating them in DRAM modules which were declared with origin other than the Republic of Korea. #NP# (19) In the light of the above, it is considered that special provisions are needed in order to ensure that the countervailing duty is levied on DRAM chips or mounted DRAMs manufactured by companies subject to the countervailing duty and incorporated in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea. #NP# (20) One of the companies subject to the countervailing duty argued that once DRAM chips or mounted DRAMs are incorporated in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs, they can no longer be considered as a product potentially subject to the countervailing duty. In this respect, it is considered that DRAM chips or mounted DRAMs once incorporated in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs still maintain their properties and functions. The fact of being incorporated in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs does not alter their basic physical and technical characteristics. Moreover, the function performed by the multi-combinational forms of DRAMs, which is to provide memory, is exactly, although on a larger scale, the same as the one of DRAM chips or mounted DRAMs when considered individually. Therefore, it is concluded that the incorporation of DRAM chips or mounted DRAMs in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs does not change their nature and cannot be considered as a reason to exclude them from the application of the countervailing duty. For these reasons, the claim was rejected. #NP# (21) The same party and the Government of the Republic of Korea argued that DRAM chips and mounted DRAMs presented in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs are not referred to in Article 1(1) of the original Regulation since they would not have been covered by the original investigation. As already mentioned in recital 13, Article 1(1) of the original Regulation clearly specifies that the countervailing duty is also imposed on DRAM chips and mounted DRAMs presented in multi-combinational forms. As to the claim that mounted DRAMs presented in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs would not have been investigated in the original investigation, no evidence was provided which could show that this was the case. On the contrary, given the nature of the subsidies received, all the sales of the investigated companies were taken into account to assess the level of subsidisation in the original investigation. For these reasons, the claim was rejected. #NP# 2. Anomalies resulting from the analysis of the trade flows #NP# (22) In the light of the non-preferential rules of origin applicable in the Community to DRAMs, import flows were analysed in relation to two main categories of the product concerned: on the one hand DRAM wafers, chips and mounted DRAMs, which originate in the country where the operation of diffusion takes place [5] and, on the other hand, multi-combinational forms of DRAMs, which originate in the country that meets the criteria indicated in recital (17). The analysis covered the period running from May 2003 to May 2005 and was based on Comext statistics at TARIC code level. #NP# (23) With regard to the first category of the product concerned, it was established on the basis of information submitted by the Community industry that the operation of diffusion is currently taking place exclusively in the following countries outside the Community (in decreasing order of manufacturing capacity): the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, the United States of America, Japan, Singapore and the People's Republic of China. It therefore results that imports declared as originating in countries other than these ones are wrongly declared. This fact appears to be particularly evident for imports declared as originating in Malaysia, Hong Kong and, to a certain extent, the People's Republic of China which has only limited diffusion capacities. In addition to these latter countries, imports of DRAMs were also reported in Comext from other countries. #NP# (24) Given the fact that the applicable non-preferential rules of origin are sufficiently clear and that any wrong indication of origin in the customs declaration can be addressed by customs authorities in line with the applicable legislation, it is considered that the most appropriate way to solve this problem is to regularly inform customs authorities of countries where the operation of diffusion takes place so that appropriate controls can be made. #NP# (25) With regard to the second category of the product concerned, it was found that they represent the bulk of imports into the Community (73 %) out of all types of DRAMs. In particular, imports declared as originating in Malaysia represent 78 % out of all types imported from this country, 95 % for Hong Kong and 93 % for the People's Republic of China. #NP# (26) As explained above, no or limited diffusion operations take place in the countries mentioned in recital 25. In this regard, evidence was provided showing that the maximum amount of value that could be added in these countries was likely to be insufficient to meet the 45 % value required by existing rules of origin and furthermore was even more unlikely to constitute the major portion of the overall manufacturing process. #NP# (27) In the light of the above, it is considered that special provisions are needed in order to ensure that the origin of multi-combinational forms of DRAMs is correctly declared and customs authorities are enabled to perform the appropriate checks. #NP# D. PROPOSED SPECIAL PROVISIONS #NP# (28) In the light of the above findings, it is concluded that special provisions are needed for the purpose of: #NP# (a) clarifying the description of the product concerned; #NP# (b) ensuring that the origin of multi-combinational forms of DRAMs is correctly declared and customs authorities are enabled to perform the appropriate checks; #NP# (c) ensuring the levy of the countervailing duty on import of multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea and incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea; #NP# (d) ensuring the levy of the countervailing duty in case of lack of information or lack of cooperation by the declarant. #NP# (29) The special provision referred to under point (a) of recital 28 should consist in a clearer description of the product concerned, singling out all different forms of DRAMs and mentioning explicitly mounted DRAMs. #NP# (30) The special provisions referred to under points (b) and (c) of recital (28) should take the form of a reference number to be indicated by the declarant in box 44 of the Single Administrative Document (SAD) at the moment of the customs declaration for release into free circulation of the imported DRAM. Such a number should correspond to the description of the multi-combinational form of DRAM which takes into consideration 1. its form, 2. its origin (""Republic of Korea"" or ""countries other than the Republic of Korea""), 3. the Korean company (""Samsung"" or ""all companies other than Samsung""), if applicable, involved in the manufacturing process, and 4. in case of multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung, the value represented by the DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs out of the overall value of the multi-combinational form of DRAM. The following reference numbers corresponding to the below product/origin descriptions should apply: #NP# No | Product/origin description | Reference number | #NP# 1. | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea or originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by Samsung | D010 | #NP# 2. | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing less than 10 % of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D011 | #NP# 3. | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing 10 % or more but less than 20 % of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D012 | #NP# 4. | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing 20 % or more but less than 30 % of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D013 | #NP# 5. | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing 30 % or more but less than 40 % of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D014 | #NP# 6. | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing 40 % or more but less than 50 % of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D015 | #NP# 7. | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing 50 % or more of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D016 | #NP# (31) The product/origin description falling under number 1 should not be accompanied by any additional supporting evidence. Indeed, the indication of a reference number, as such, is considered as sufficient to raise the attention of the declarant to the need to check carefully the origin and the location of all manufacturers involved. Moreover, any additional document would put an undue burden on the declarant in case of imports of DRAMs in the manufacture of which no company subject to the countervailing duty has intervened. #NP# (32) The product/origin descriptions falling under numbers 2 to 7 should, on the contrary, be accompanied by a statement issued by the last manufacturer of the DRAM and submitted by the declarant together with the SAD at the moment of the customs declaration for release into free circulation, in conformity with the text provided in the Annex. Such a statement should mention, inter alia, the value of the manufacturing process carried out by the companies subject to the countervailing duty out of the overall value of the imported DRAMs. #NP# (33) With regard to the countervailing duty rate applicable to multi-combinational forms of DRAMs falling under numbers 2 to 7, this should be calculated in proportion to the value represented by the incorporated DRAM chip and/or mounted DRAM originating in the Republic of Korea out of the overall value of the multi-combinational form of DRAM. With a view to simplifying the customs procedure and the application of the appropriate duty rates corresponding to that value, the following six levels of duty rates should be established, each corresponding to the following numbers of product/origin descriptions: #NP# - No 2: a duty rate of 0 % should apply; #NP# - No 3: a duty rate of 3,4 % should apply; #NP# - No 4: a duty rate of 6,9 % should apply; #NP# - No 5: a duty rate of 10,4 % should apply; #NP# - No 6: a duty rate of 13,9 % should apply; #NP# - No 7: a duty rate of 17,4 % should apply. #NP# (34) Each level of duty rate established in recital (33) corresponds to the lowest percentage (foreseen for the relevant range of multi-combinational forms of DRAMs) applied to the countervailing duty (for example, 10 % of 34,8 % for multi-combinational forms of DRAMs falling under No 3, i.e. 3,4 %), to ensure a balanced application of the provision and to avoid any disproportionate burden to the economic operators importing and selling the product concerned in the Community. #NP# (35) Finally, with regard to the special provision referred to under point (d) of recital 28, it is considered that the lack of both the indication of a reference number in box 44 of the SAD, as foreseen in recital 30, and of a statement, in the cases mentioned in recital (32), should trigger the application of the countervailing duty rate of 34,8 % since it should be assumed ‚Äî unless the contrary is proved ‚Äî that the multi-combinational form of DRAM is originating in the Republic of Korea and has been manufactured by companies subject to the countervailing duty. #NP# (36) In addition, in the cases mentioned in recital 32, should some of the DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs incorporated in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs not be clearly marked and their manufacturers not be clearly identifiable from the required statement, it should be assumed ‚Äî unless the contrary is proved ‚Äî that such DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs are originating in the Republic of Korea and have been manufactured by companies subject to the countervailing duty. This should trigger the application of the countervailing duty rate of 34,8 % in those cases where, as a consequence of the above, the multi-combinational form of DRAMs originate in the Republic of Korea. In all other cases, the applicable countervailing duty should be the rate foreseen in recital 33, corresponding to the ranges of values established in recital 30. #NP# (37) With regard to the special provision and the circumstances referred to in recitals 35 and 36, it was found that DRAM suppliers have contractual obligations vis-√†-vis their clients to maintain certain specifications defined by industry standards, including the reference to the name of the companies where diffusion and assembly took place. Hence, it is considered that the information and the evidence to be provided are not putting any undue burden on the declarant, #NP# HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: #NP# Article 1 #NP# Council Regulation (EC) No 1480/2003 is hereby amended as follows: #NP# 1.

24,52005XC1025_01,en,2005,"Commission communication pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 #NP# Modification by the United Kingdom of public service obligations in respect of scheduled air services between the Orkney Mainland (Kirkwall) and the islands of Papa Westray and North Ronaldsay #NP# (2005/C 264/04) #NP# (Text with EEA relevance) #NP# 1. The United Kingdom has decided to modify the public service obligations in respect of the scheduled air services between the Orkney Mainland (Kirkwall) and the islands of Papa Westray and North Ronaldsay as set out in the Notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities C 394/04 of 30 December 1997, as modified in the Official Journal of the European Communities/Union C 369/2 of 22 December 2000, C 363/06 of 19 December 2001, C 295/09 of 5 December 2003 and C 306/07 of 10 December 2004 pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes. #NP# 2. The modified public service obligations are as follows: #NP# ‚Äî Minimum frequencies: #NP# - to Papa Westray: 3 return frequencies during the summer timetable and 2 return frequencies during the winter timetable on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday; 2 return frequencies on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday all year round; and one return frequency on Sunday all year round; #NP# - to North Ronaldsay: 3 return frequencies during the summer timetable and 2 return frequencies during the winter timetable on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday; and 2 return frequencies on Tuesday all year round. #NP# ‚Äî Capacity: #NP# The capacity of the aircraft used should be not less than 8 passenger seats on each route. #NP# ‚Äî Fares: #NP# The price of a single adult fare must not exceed GBP 15 on each route. #NP# The maximum fare on each route may be increased once a year with the prior written consent of Orkney Islands Council in line with the United Kingdom's Retail Price Index (all items) or any successor index to this. #NP# No other changes may be made to the fare levels without the prior written consent of Orkney Islands Council. #NP# The new maximum fare on each route must be notified to the Civil Aviation Authority and will not enter into force prior to their notification to the European Commission which may then publish them in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# Under Orkney Islands Council's Concessionary Fares Scheme, established under the Transport Act 1985, there are 12 free return journeys per year for those eligible between Papa Westray/North Ronaldsay and Kirkwall. These fares will be invoiced monthly to the Council and will be separate to the tender subsidy. #NP# -------------------------------------------------- #S#  #S# ",1287;3774;5152;663;4136;4505;4379,52;72;48;04,5211;7206;7231;7236;4811;7211;0436;4826;4806,3146;122;2106;2200;4590;5283;913;2181;3780;77;4505;3101,3146;1287;122;3774;2106;2200;4590;5283;913;2181;5152;3780;663;77;4136;4505;3101;4379,train

INTRODUCTION #NP# THE AIM OF THIS GREEN PAPER IS TO SEEK VIEWS from all relevant stakeholders on the future of the European Migration Network (EMN), including options for its possible tasks and structure. #NP# The EMN was set up in 2002 as a pilot/preparatory action in response to the identified need to improve the exchange of information on all aspects of migration and asylum. Its primary objective is to provide the Community and its Member States with objective, reliable and comparable information in these fields by systematically collecting and storing existing data and information from Member States and carrying out national and European level analysis. At present, the EMN consists of national contact points designated by Member States and a scientific coordinator, both supported and monitored by the European Commission. #NP# As the preparatory action will be drawing to a close in 2006, it is necessary to take stock of the progress made so far and launch, through this Green Paper, a reflection on the best way forward #NP# 2. POLICY BACKGROUND #NP# Already in 1994, the European Commission stressed in its first communication on immigration and asylum policies the value of creating a mechanism to monitor migration flows on a comprehensive and EU-wide basis. In response, a feasibility study was carried out in 1996[1]. #NP# In its conclusions the Laeken European Council of December 2001 invited the Commission ‚Äòto establish a system for exchange of information on asylum, migration and countries of origin‚Äô, further to which the EMN was set up as a pilot project in 2002. #NP# To start implementation, it was agreed with Member States to first set up a network of national contact points that would provide the necessary information. #NP# The European Council of Thessaloniki in June 2003 endorsed the creation of the EMN and proposed to examine the possibility of ‚Äòcreating a permanent structure in the future‚Äô. #NP# Finally, in the Hague Programme the European Council of 4-5 November 2004 states that the ongoing development of European asylum and migration policy should be based on a common analysis of migratory phenomena in all their aspects. Reinforcing the collection, provision, exchange, and efficient use of up-to-date information and data on all relevant migratory developments is of key importance‚Äô. #NP# 3. EXISTING INFORMATION GAPS #NP# IMPORTANT INFORMATION N eeds, as already identified by the 1996 feasibility study and confirmed by the 2005 evaluation of the EMN[2], continue to exist in the field of migration and asylum for policy makers at both EU and Member States level which any future EMN structure should contribute to satisfying. #NP# First, despite the huge amount of information on many aspects of international migration that is being produced, access to this information is not easy to obtain, as it is dispersed and not centrally available. A single reference point for the filtering and synthesising of this information that could serve as a clearing house would therefore be very useful to EU institutions and Member States, both policy makers and the general public. #NP# Second, there is insufficient reliable, comparable and up-to-date information and analysis of legal and policy developments with regard to asylum and migration, both at national and EU level. There is also insufficient comparable information on effects of EU and national policies in this area. In addition, there exists an increasing need for the EU and its Member States to obtain quick responses on specific issues related to migration and asylum. To fill these information gaps, some kind of network structure would be required that could reach out to all Member States, combined with a certain level of central coordination. #NP# Third, a major problem lies in the lack of accurate, up-to-date and comparable statistical data on migration and asylum. The recently adopted Commission proposal for a regulation on Community statistics on migration and international protection[3] will tackle this problem, but there will continue to be a need for the comparative analysis of such statistical information. #NP# 4. THE CURRENT EMN #NP# THIS SECTION DESCRIBES THE CURRENT EMN INSOFAR AS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND ITS FUNCTIONING, OUTPUTS AND PROBLEMS WITH A VIEW TO DETERMINING its future structure[4]. #NP# 4.1. Status and structure #NP# At present, the EMN consists of a network of 14 national contact points (NCPs) designated by Member States. The NCPs are at the core of the network as they carry out the documentation and analysis and research activities. The majority of new Member States have not yet designated NCPs and participate as observers. It is expected that some will become full members of the EMN in 2006. #NP# NCPs range from structures within or attached to Ministries of Interior or Justice, national statistical offices and research institutes, to structures within non-governmental and welfare institutions to national offices of intergovernmental organisations. NCPs are rather frequently changed, for instance following a reorganization of responsibility between Ministries. #NP# A scientific and administrative co-ordinator was selected in December 2003 following an open invitation to tender to assist in the development of the network. #NP# 4.2 Financing #NP# The current network is co-financed between the Commission and Member States. Some NCPs that are part of or attached to Member States‚Äô administrations did not receive Community funding due to constraints linked with national public finance rules or Community eligibility rules. The financial resources allocated to set up the network increased from ‚Ç¨ 1.4 million for the 2002 pilot action to ‚Ç¨ 3.0 million for the 2005 budget that will be implemented in 2006, including grants for 9 NCPs and financial provisions for the scientific and administrative coordination of the network. #NP# 4.3 Tasks and main achievements #NP# The primary objective of the EMN as set out in its original specifications is to provide the Community, its Member States, and in the longer term the public with objective, reliable and comparable information on the migration and asylum situation at the European and national levels. #NP# This is to be accomplished by bringing together and making accessible existing data and information as well as reviewing and analysing relevant existing information. #NP# The EMN therefore focuses on two interrelated activities: documentation and analysis, and research. This includes information monitoring, comparison, analysis and research, through collating existing information from Member States and undertaking some own research for European-level analysis, and developing a comprehensive database for such information. Networks at national level contribute to the EMN‚Äôs analysis and research activity. EMN action is implemented on the basis of annual work programmes approved by the Commission. #NP# Against this background, the following principal achievements ‚Äìapart from the actual setting up of the NCPs in terms of staff, facilities and IT equipment- can be identified from 2002 until now: #NP# Documentation facility #NP# In order to comply with the objective to developing a comprehensive repository for data and information, a computer-based information system is being set up which constitutes the backbone of the EMN operation. The web-based user interface developed in 2004 facilitates data collection and documentation by offering a practical system of templates that provide for the direct upload of the collected data into the information system. The system also provides for a search and navigation mechanism. #NP# The system is nearing completion so that its functioning will now be a matter of inputting data and information. In this respect, by mid-2005, NCP‚Äôs had uploaded more than 1700 publications; in addition legal documents and contacts of both organisations and individuals active in the field had been indexed. Efforts are currently undertaken to improve the quality of these entries through common guidelines to be followed when uploading information. It is obvious that many more inputs are needed if the EMN documentation centre is to provide a comprehensive collection of policy-relevant and up-to-date information on asylum and migration for policy makers, practitioners and eventually the general public. #NP# Analysis and research activity #NP# The EMN has completed several analysis and research projects and information outputs, among these the 2004 pilot research study on the impact of immigration on Europe‚Äôs societies[5]; contributions to 2001-2003 EU annual reports on statistics[6] by supplying information on national policies and practices, and analysing national figures; the 2004 policy analysis report that served to obtain an overview of national policy developments and to conduct a comparative overview, as well as other research studies. Currently, with a view to filling information gaps in two policy relevant areas, a second research study on state approaches towards illegally resident third country nationals and a small scale study on reception systems for asylum applicants are in preparation. #NP# Even though it is still early to assess the overall quality of the EMN outputs, it can be said that NCPs produced high quality reports that give an indication of the network‚Äôs capacities, especially within the context of providing reliable and up-to-date analysis that allows for comparison between Member States. #NP# Networking and Visibility #NP# Bilateral contacts between NCPs have intensified as the network progresses. As regards networking at national level, most NCPs have succeeded in establishing national networks of relevant actors and setting up procedures for obtaining inputs from their partners. A national network directory that provides an overview of potential and actual network partners has been established. Efforts were also made to establish contacts with other networks and projects at EU level. However, these contacts have not led to intensified collaboration which would be required for the EMN to ensure synergies and avoid overlaps. #NP# The visibility of the EMN to the outside world is currently limited, as very few of its products are (yet) accessible to the public. This prevents the network‚Äôs results from being taken fully into account. The lack of visibility is mainly due to the fact that the network started from scratch so that the first years of operation had to be used for its setting up. Various efforts are however currently underway with a view to improving the EMN‚Äôs visibility and spreading its research results[7]. #NP# 4.4 Assessment #NP# The 2005 evaluation report identified several difficulties that the current EMN has been confronted with in fulfilling its tasks, the two most important being the structure of national contact points and the general set-up of the project. #NP# As to the first factor, there is a great heterogeneity in the legal status and in the specialisation of the NCPs as well as in the human, financial resources and technical equipment made available and therefore in their level of commitment. In addition, NCPs have been designated at different points in time and are also frequently changed, be it due to changes in the personnel or as a consequence of a shift of responsibility to a different ministry. The result is that NCPs are at very different stages of their development. #NP# Concerning the second factor, the institutional arrangement and set up chosen required a rather high level of input from the Commission. In addition, the administrative process chosen for setting up and running the network- i.e. a co-financed action- proved to be resource intensive. The appointment of a scientific coordinator improved the overall situation, although there is still a need to identify more clearly the role of the Commission. #NP# In addition, the initial tasks and functions of the EMN were rather wide, owing to the pilot nature of the project and its experimental start-up. The definition of roles and functions of both the network as a whole and the NCPs, and their relation with the coordinator, therefore lacked a certain clarity and focus. #NP# On the whole, while progress towards the achievement of its objective can be accounted for especially in 2004, structural problems inherent to the current set-up of the EMN inhibit more and faster progress to be made. Any future structure should therefore seek to address and avoid these problems. It should also to the extent possible build on what has already been and will still be achieved by the current EMN. #NP# 5. A FUTURE EUROPEAN MIGRATION NETWORK #NP# AGAINST THE ABOVE BACKGROUND, THIS SECTION BRINGS FORWARD A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE RELEVANT WHEN DECIDING ON A FUTURE STRUCTURE to be set up from 2007, it being understood that these elements are interdependent. Participants are invited to comment on these options put forward by the Commission. #NP# 5.1. General objective and fields of action #NP# Given the existing information gaps in the field of migration and asylum as outlined above, the general objective of the current EMN to provide the Community, its Member States and the general public with objective, reliable and comparable information remains valid and relevant. This information should be made available with a view to supporting the common immigration and asylum policies. #NP# Concerning outputs, and in particular the database, the starting point would be that these should be accessible to the general public, in line with the objective. However, there may be cases where it would prove useful or even necessary to restrict such access to a specific user group, for instance for pieces of information that Member States consider confidential. #NP# Do you agree with such a mandate ‚Äìto provide the Community, its Member States and the general public with objective, reliable and comparable information in the field of asylum and migration- for a future EMN? If not, which changes should be made to the mandate, and why? Should the data and information collected by the EMN systematically be made publicly available? | #NP# - 5.2. Concrete tasks #NP# It needs to be determined which concrete tasks a future structure should fulfil in order to achieve the general objective outlined above. #NP# Tasks currently undertaken focus on the collection of existing data and information, a limited amount of research, the exchange and documentation of these data; analysis of the data and production of comparative reports, and networking. #NP# In particular, as regards the provision of comparable information, the EMN could develop an in-depth understanding of methodological differences that may hinder data comparison, and develop an adequate, common methodology to overcome such differences. #NP# Moreover one could envisage that a certain amount of further research be launched and implemented by a future EMN in areas of identified information gaps, either as part of its agreed work programme or upon the specific request of Community institutions, and possibly other actors[8]. #NP# Depending on the further structure to be chosen, other tasks could include the issuing of views and opinions on the basis of the information collection and analysis activities. The purpose would be to provide guidance and advice on policy developments and implementation. It may, however, be premature to charge the EMN with such tasks, in the sense that it may be preferable for a future structure to concentrate on core tasks of data collection and analysis, in order to first build up a certain authority in the field. #NP# The current network‚Äôs low visibility combined with the need for it to liaise with other bodies active in the field calls for pro-active dissemination and awareness raising activities, including organising meetings and conferences on migration and asylum to provide a forum for key stakeholders. However, such tasks would require substantive additional resources. #NP# Which of the above mentioned concrete tasks ‚Äìcollection and analysis of information, research, issuing opinions and recommendations, and awareness raising activities- should a future structure be given and why? Can you suggest other tasks that should be fulfilled? | #NP# - 5.3. Relations with other information gathering bodies and institutional stakeholders #NP# It is essential that maximum synergies with other actions carried out in this field by the Commission, the EU, the Member States or international organisations is ensured in order to draw a maximum benefit and to achieve complementarity. #NP# The future EMN should be seen as part of the more general reorganisation and rationalisation of information exchange instruments that is ongoing in the area of immigration and asylum. This includes instruments such as the forthcoming proposal on a mutual information system, practical cooperation in the field of asylum or the recently adopted regulation on Community statistics on migration and international protection[9]. #NP# In order to achieve synergies, it is necessary to network with other bodies that carry out activities related to the ones the EMN pursues. Certain Community-level actors are concerned with similar information collection and analysis, such as the future Fundamental Rights Agency[10] and CARIM[11] in particular. The Fundamental Rights Agency will be an independent centre of expertise concerning fundamental rights issues. Its main tasks will include data collection, analysis, advice, networking and awareness-raising. The CARIM project offers an instrument for observing, analysing and forecasting migratory movements, their causes and consequences that originate from transit through or are destined for the countries of the Barcelona process. These actors have a different mandate and brief than the EMN, as their focus on migration is mostly concerned with migrants‚Äô rights, or relates to specific countries. This decreases risk of overlap. Still there is a need for a future EMN to create strong and structured links with them. #NP# As regards relations with institutional stakeholders, such as the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, these should be, together with the Member States and the Commission, the principal beneficiaries of a future EMN‚Äôs activities. One may also consider whether these stakeholders should be able to ask for specific information to be then provided by the NCP‚Äôs, for example when preparing its opinions on proposals for legislation. #NP# How can close cooperation with stakeholders be assured? How can a future structure build on and complement existing national and international bodies in the field of migration and asylum? | #NP# - 5.4. Form and structure #NP# This section addresses the question of which structures could enable the implementation of the objective and the range of possible tasks, and which advantages and disadvantages each structure would imply. #NP# Depending on the objective, concrete tasks to be allocated and resources available, a future EMN could take different forms. Amongst them, two different structures could be considered, the fundamental choices being between a network attached to and working under the responsibility of the Commission, or a network selected and operated by an independent Community agency. #NP# Option 1: Network attached to the Commission #NP# A future EMN could consist of a network of national contact points. The Commission would assume responsibility for the overall direction, programming and further development of the network‚Äôs activities. A legal basis would be required that would establish the future EMN and set out its main objectives, including the criteria that NCPs should fulfil. This could take the form of a Council decision. #NP# Under this option, it would be up to the Commission to designate appropriate management structures. This could imply the appointment of a private or public coordinating body following an open call for tenders. #NP# As regards the selection of NCPs, one could either envisage that they are selected by Member States, in accordance with the criteria set out in the legal basis, or by the Commission, through a call for proposals. #NP# Attaching the network to the Commission would guarantee that the Commission assumes the overall political responsibility for its activities. It would allow a seamless move from the current EMN and could also be considered as a transitional phase before shifting to a more permanent and institutionalised structure, should there prove to be a need. However, efficient management would have to be ensured, and one may question in this respect whether outsourcing of tasks to a contractor could provide sufficient continuity. Indeed, the Commission‚Äôs procurement rules foresee a certain maximum duration for such contracts. #NP# Option 2: Agency #NP# A Community agency could be considered as a longer term option, depending not only on the further development of the common immigration and asylum policies but also on the Financial Perspectives, taking into account the limited budget available. It should be underlined that an agency would require a legal basis to establish it; it would also imply a management board with representatives from Member States and the Commission. #NP# Such a stable structure would provide a longer term perspective in its activities and would also allow a wider range of tasks to be fulfilled. It could, therefore, be in a position to provide more effectively the information required. #NP# If such an agency were to be considered as appropriate for fulfilling the envisaged new tasks, there would have to be sufficient justification for its need and for its potential continuity. This would imply an impact assessment in order to analyse fully the implications of such an agency. In this context, the use of other agencies - existing or future -in the area of Justice and Home Affairs could be examined. #NP# Role and status of national contact points #NP# Whatever option will be chosen, and if the overall mandate as outlined above is accepted, this results in certain implications for the role and status of NCPs, as the information gathering and analysis activities at national level will be carried out by them. #NP# NCPs therefore have to be in a position to deliver this information, i.e. to broadly cover their respective Member State, and they have to be able to ensure the permanent updating of the database. A core function is to mobilise and be at the centre of a national network of relevant actors in the field, such as researchers and research institutions, public and governmental authorities, and NGOs, that would contribute to the activities. To that end, NCPs should be independent from governments, but at the same time establish good relations to public bodies, in order to have access to public sector information. #NP# In this respect, in order that NCPs are in a position to fulfil these tasks and to achieve a certain level of homogeneity among them, a set of minimum requirements in terms of overall experience in the field, staffing, capacity, IT and other equipment, would have to be specified. #NP# Which structure should be put in place for the next stage of the EMN to achieve the overall objective, and why? Which role and status is needed for the NCPs? How best should the national networks be structured? | #NP# - 6. CONCLUSION #NP# IN THIS GREEN PAPER, THE COMMISSION HAS TRIED TO OUTLINE THE MAIN ISSUES AT STAKE AND HAS PUT FORWARD A NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN SETTING UP A FUTURE EMN STRUCTURE. #NP# The primary aim of the Green Paper is to call for reactions and launch an in-depth consultation among all relevant stakeholders. To that end, the Commission would like to receive contributions by 28 January 2006, to be sent by e-mail to the following address: #NP# jls-migration-network@cec.eu.int #NP# Contributions received will be published on the Commission‚Äôs website in the language in which they were submitted and with the authors‚Äô names, unless they indicate their wish to remain anonymous or request that their entire contribution be treated as confidential. #S#  #S# ANNEXES #NP# ANNEX 1: NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS AND COORDINATOR #NP# National Contact Points: #NP# Austria: #NP# International Organisation for MigrationNibelungengasse 13/4,1010 Vienna, Austriancpaustria@iom.intwww.emn.at #NP# Belgium: #NP# SPF Int√©rieur, DG Office des Etrangers,59b Chauss√©e d¬¥Anvers1000 Bruxelles, Belgiumemn@ibz.fgov.bewww.ibz.fgov.be #NP# Czech Republic: #NP# Ministry of the InteriorUnit of International RelationsAnd Information on Countries of OriginDepartment for Asylum and Migration PoliciesMV ‚Äì P.O. box 21/Oam170 34 Prague 7, Czech Republicopu@mvcr.cz #NP# Finland:Statistics FinlandP.O.

42,52005PC0623,en,2005,"[pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | #NP# Brussels, 30.11.2005 #NP# COM(2005) 623 final #NP# 2005/0243 (ACC) #NP# Proposal for a #NP# COUNCIL REGULATION #NP# amending Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community #NP# (presented by the Commission) #NP# EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM #NP# CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | #NP# Grounds for and objectives of the proposal Ukraine completed a reform process aiming at functioning according to market economy rules and should thus now be granted market economy status (MES) for the purpose of anti-dumping investigations. This requires an amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (the 'Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation'). | #NP# General context Ukraine lodged its documented request to the European Union for graduation to MES for the purpose of trade defence investigations in May 2002. Ukraine's request was examined in the light of the following cumulative criteria, which seem pertinent in order to assess whether a country as a whole can be treated as a market economy country for the purpose of anti-dumping investigations: 1. Low degree of government influence over the allocation of resources and decisions of enterprises, whether directly or indirectly (e.g. public bodies), for example through the use of State-fixed prices, or discrimination in the tax, trade or currency regimes. 2. Absence of State-induced distortions in the operation of enterprises linked to privatisation (i.e. ""carry over"" from the old system). Absence of use of non-market trading or compensation systems (such as barter trade). 3. Existence and implementation of a transparent and non-discriminatory company law which ensures adequate corporate governance (application of international accounting standards, protection of shareholders, public availability of accurate company information). 4. Existence and implementation of a coherent, effective and transparent set of laws which ensure the respect of property rights and the operation of a functioning bankruptcy regime. 5. Existence of a genuine financial sector which operates independently from the State and which in law and practice is subject to sufficient guarantee provisions and adequate supervision. In order to determine whether Ukraine fulfilled these criteria, the Commission services examined the information provided by the Ukrainian authorities and compared it also with information obtained from a number of authoritative external sources (OECD, IMF, EBRD, World Bank etc.) as well as from its own anti-dumping investigations involving Ukrainian exports. In March 2003 the Commission issued its preliminary assessment of Ukraine's MES request, concluding that, despite progress, the five MES criteria had not been met. The Ukrainian authorities were thus requested to implement certain actions and provide additional information in respect of all five criteria. In a new assessment issued in May 2004, the Commission concluded that three of the criteria could be considered as solved, and that only two areas remained where further progress and/or respectively further information was needed in order for Ukraine to be graduated to MES: bankruptcy legislation and price interference by the State. After Ukraine has taken further steps to improve its bankruptcy legislation and to solve the issue of price interference by the State, the Commission now considers that Ukraine fulfils all the criteria in order to be granted MES for the purpose of trade defence investigations. | #NP# Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. | #NP# Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. | #NP# CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | #NP# Consultation of interested parties | #NP# Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents The Commission informed the industry and consulted Member States in the relevant trade committees about the proposed amendments. | #NP# Summary of responses and how they have been taken into account The Commission has considered the comments and suggestions received. | #NP# Collection and use of expertise | #NP# There was no need for external expertise. | #NP# Impact assessment The MES graduation of Ukraine will trigger a change in the methodology used to establish the dumping margin for Ukrainian exporters subject to anti-dumping investigations. This change is automatic whenever a third country is being granted MES. | #NP# LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | #NP# Summary of the proposed action It is proposed to remove Ukraine from the list of economies in transition in the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation. | #NP# Legal basis Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133. | #NP# Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. | #NP# Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). | #NP# The Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation foresees a form of action which does not leave scope for national decision. The proposed amendment does not change anything in that respect. | #NP# An indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Community, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable as the proposal does not entail any financial or administrative burdens. | #NP# Choice of instruments | #NP# Proposed instruments: regulation. | #NP# Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: the current proposal is an amendment of an existing Regulation. | #NP# BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | #NP# The proposal has no implication for the Community budget. | #NP# 1. 2005/0243 (ACC) #NP# Proposal for a #NP# COUNCIL REGULATION #NP# amending Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community #NP# THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, #NP# Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], #NP# Whereas: #NP# (1) By Regulation (EC) No 384/96[2] (the 'Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation') the Council adopted common rules for protection against dumped imports from countries which are not members of the European Communities. #NP# (2) In view of the very significant progress made by Ukraine towards the establishment of market economy conditions, as recognised by the conclusions of the Ukraine-European Union Summit on 1 December 2005, it is appropriate to allow normal value for Ukrainian exporters and producers to be established in accordance with the provisions of Article 2(1) to (6) of the Basic Anti-dumping Regulation. #NP# HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: #NP# Article 1 #NP# In Regulation (EC) No 384/96, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 461/2004, in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of Article 2(7), the term ‚Äúthe Ukraine‚Äù is deleted. #NP# Article 2 #NP# This Regulation shall apply to all investigations initiated pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 384/96 after the date of entry into force of this Regulation on the basis of an application for initiation lodged after such date. #NP# Article 3 #NP# This Regulation shall enter into force on the 7th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union . #NP# This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. #S# Done at Brussels, #NP# For the Council #NP# The President #NP# [1] OJ C , , p. . #NP# [2] OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.

Indeed, the three key objectives of freedom, security and justice are to be developed in parallel and with the same degree of intensity, thus allowing for a balanced approach, based on the principles of democracy, respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, and the rule of law. Each of these objectives is subject to a Framework programme, providing for the necessary coherence between the interventions in each policy area, and clearly linking political objectives and the resources available to support them. Furthermore, this structure represents a major simplification and rationalisation of existing financial support in the area of freedom, justice and security, thus allowing for greater flexibility in the allocation of priorities and increasing overall transparency. #NP# 1. INTRODUCTION #NP# European integration has moved forward primarily in the economic sphere, with the setting-up of a Single Market and a single currency. The establishment of an integrated, frontier-free economic area was, as foreseen by the Amsterdam Treaty, complemented by the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. This area now needs to be further developed and strengthened. #NP# In the Communication ‚ÄúBuilding our common Future: Policy challenges and budgetary means of the Enlarged Union 2007-2013‚Äù[1] the Commission stated ‚ÄúFreedom, Security and Justice are core values which constitute key components of the European model of society. (‚Ä¶) In this context, developing this dimension of the European Union is the new frontier for integration: a true area of Freedom, Security and Justice is an indispensable building block of the European Union, at the heart of the political project for an enlarged Union‚Äù [2] . #NP# The various aspects of the area of freedom, security and justice form a balance between guaranteeing the core rights of the individual as well as delivering the core responsibilities expected of the Union[3]. #NP# The development of an area of freedom, security and justice responds to a central concern of the peoples of the States brought together within the Union. For that reason the European Council adopted The Hague Programme in November 2004, as a follow up to the programme adopted by the Tampere European Council in 1999. Building upon the results of the Tampere programme, The Hague Programme presents a new agenda to enable the Union to further develop what has already been achieved and to meet new challenges. It also emphasizes that the creation of a Europe for citizens requires not only the full respect of Fundamental Rights, but in addition the active promotion of those rights. #NP# By integrating the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Constitutional Treaty acknowledges the Union‚Äôs values and objectives. Furthermore, accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) will strengthen the European commitment to protecting human rights by introducing external judicial review of the European Union‚Äôs respect for fundamental rights[4]. Increased protection and promotion of fundamental rights also implies that more concerted action should be taken against racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism phenomena by giving greater support to interfaith and multicultural dialogue, with a view to foster understanding and mutual knowledge. #NP# These developments imply a significant reinforcement of the fundamental values which are at the heart of the European project. The Union will be legally obliged not only to respect these rights and values, but also to ensure that they are effectively promoted in all policy areas (both internal and external) for which the European Union is competent. Furthermore, monitoring activities will have to increase rapidly to ensure that the Member States adopt the same approach in their areas of competence, particularly in the context of a growing and ever more diverse Union and the challenges that this will bring. The promotion of European Union citizenship should develop a feeling of belonging to a union that shares the same fundamental rights and values, while preserving and respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe. #NP# The fight against violence clearly forms part of the protection of fundamental rights as set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular the right to physical integrity. The links between violence and several other fundamental rights (liberty, security, health, employment, etc.) are so strong that the general implementation of these rights, as they relate to the physical integrity of the person, should be supported. The same applies to the fight against drug use and trafficking, an area where at European level a comprehensive, multidisciplinary and integrated strategy has been followed since 1990, but without any clearly identifiable financial support. This strategy is based on five main elements: reducing demand, reducing supply and combating illicit trafficking, international co-operation and co-ordination at national and European level, and information, research and evaluation. #NP# The creation of a Europe for citizens also implies the establishment of a European Area of Justice, based on the principle of mutual recognition and confidence-building: borders between countries should no longer constitute an obstacle to the settlement of civil and commercial law matters or to the bringing of court proceedings and the enforcement of decisions. Whilst the principle of free movement allows individuals and businesses to pursue their civil and commercial interests in other Member States, it also requires measures in the criminal law field to ensure that there are no safe havens for crime and criminals. Indeed, individuals and businesses should not be prevented or discouraged from exercising their rights because of the incompatibility or complexity of legal and administrative systems in the Member States. #NP# Achieving these common goals will require a stable financial framework. The preparation of the next financial perspectives 2007-2013 offers an important opportunity to take into account the developments described above and hence to shape the political project for the enlarged Union. #NP# 2. THE PROPOSED INTERVENTION - FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND JUSTICE #NP# 2.1. Objectives and structure of the programme #NP# To respond to the challenges outlined above, it is proposed to establish a framework programme on ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù, with four specific objectives: #NP# 1. To promote the development of a European society based on the European Union citizenship and respectful of the fundamental rights provided for in the Charter of Fundamental Rights; to fight anti-semitism, racism and xenophobia and to strengthen civil society in the field of fundamental rights. #NP# 2. To contribute to the setting-up of an area of freedom, security and justice by combating violence and by providing information on and preventing the use of drugs. #NP# 3. To promote judicial cooperation with the aim of contributing to the creation of a genuine European area of justice in civil and commercial matters. #NP# 4. To promote judicial cooperation with the aim of contributing to the creation of a genuine European area of justice in criminal matters. #NP# These objectives have a different legal basis in the Treaties. The framework programme will therefore be composed of four separate legislative instruments. Nevertheless, political coherence will be ensured, as each specific programme will reflect the objectives of a policy which will, in association with the three others, allow for the development of a European citizenship and a genuine area of Justice. Furthermore, the grouping together of these complementary policy areas under the same framework programme will not only enhance their overall coherence but also ensure a better response to the needs of the citizens. It will enable new, unexpected problems to be tackled with increased flexibility. #NP# In the field of fundamental rights and citizenship, the ultimate objective is to create a real fundamental rights culture among all the peoples of Europe. Thus, a significant effort to disseminate information on fundamental rights, both through general information campaigns and in response to individual requests, is of the utmost importance. This cannot be separated from the need to increase activities, including legislative action, to promote the application of certain rights, e.g. the right to personal physical integrity and the rights associated with Union citizenship, and to provide support and incentive measures to help Member States to comply with their obligations in their areas of competence. #NP# The fight against violence in all its forms (sexual, psychological and physical), occurring in the public or the private domain will include: support for victims and groups at risk (children, young people and women); assisting and encouraging NGOs and other organisations active in this field; dissemination of the results obtained under the two Daphne programmes including their adaptation, transfer and use by other beneficiaries or in other geographical areas; and identification of actions contributing to the positive treatment of people at risk of violence. #NP# With respect to the fight against the use of drugs, the main challenges will be the dissemination of information as well as further research resulting into education, prevention and harm-reduction programmes. Not only the reduction of drug demand, but also the reduction of drug supply will be important issues. This is an area in which measures need to be taken in order to stop drug-trafficking and drug-related criminality, in particular when new synthetic drugs or their chemical precursors are involved, and to fight the money-laundering. #NP# Judicial cooperation concerns the increased efforts to monitor the application by the Member States of the existing acquis in both civil and criminal areas and to bring together national legislations. The programme will support various actions, namely to improve the access to and efficiency of justice, to address mutual recognition in a wider sense, including recognition of decisions and documents other than those issued by judicial authorities, to strengthen the mechanisms for providing information to the public and to promote the training of and exchanges between practitioners on the implications of the instruments for cooperation in this area. It will encourage the implementation of legislative measures to put in place and develop common tools for cooperation, and equivalent standards for certain procedures such as rules on evidence collection. In addition, rules on the protection of individuals involved in criminal proceedings, whether they are the accused, witnesses or victims will also be promoted. #NP# Overall coherence is ensured across the four objectives through common implementation and management rules, in accordance with the same strategic calendar, and coordinated evaluation and review processes (see point 3.2). The programme will hence ensure rationalisation and simplification, increasing transparency and the effectiveness of Community funds. Ensuring active participation from relevant stakeholders and greater responsiveness to demands emerging from the civil society will also be a horizontal priority common to the four policy areas. #NP# 2.2. European added-value #NP# This programme will add value to existing national interventions in this field by acting as a catalyst: EU funded cooperation raises awareness of shared issues and values between Member States, thus facilitating the emergence of common approaches, including legislation in these fields. This will be achieved by implementing agreed EU policy objectives and promoting their application in national policies, supporting the transposition of European Union legislation and its uniform application throughout Europe, promoting the co-operation and co-ordination mechanisms between Member States, and cooperating with civil society organisations at European level. #NP# A set of common evaluation criteria will be used across all specific programmes to evaluate the European added value in relation to the type of effect described above. Examples of these criteria are: #NP# - To support only those activities needed at European level to sustain European Union objectives, European Union laws and European Union implementation mechanisms; #NP# - To support activities which will be complementary with those financed at national level; #NP# - To reinforce national exchanges at European Union level, generating synergy effects and economies of scale; #NP# - To actively involve Member States representatives and other relevant stakeholders in the implementation of the programme in order to maximise complementarities with existing activities. #NP# 2.3. Complementarity with other instruments and policy measures #NP# The programme will look for synergies with the work of the Fundamental Rights Agency built upon the existing European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, a Vienna-based agency, established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1035/97 of 2 June 1997[5]. Through a Communication[6], the Commission launched a wide-ranging public consultation on the future agency‚Äôs field of action and its tasks. The consultation targeted civil society such as NGOs involved with the protection of human rights, the national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights, the Member States, the EU institutions, the EUMC and the Council of Europe. The results of this consultation will be taken into account when defining the exact tasks of the Agency. However, its prime objective will be data collection and analysis with a view to defining Union policy in the field of Fundamental Rights. #NP# Concerning judicial cooperation in civil matters, the actions under the programme will be coordinated with these of the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters, established by Council Decision 2001/470/EC of 28 May 2001[7] to improve, simplify and expedite effective judicial cooperation between the Member States in civil and commercial matters. Within the specific Criminal Justice Programme, particular attention will be paid to Eurojust, which was set up by Council Decision 2002/187/JHA of 28 February 2002[8]. Eurojust is a European Union body established to enhance the effectiveness of the competent authorities within Member States when they are dealing with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organised crime, including terrorism, by stimulating and improving cooperation between those authorities. Eurojust places an emphasis on ensuring full cooperation between the competent national authorities and is therefore an essential complement to the Fundamental Rights and Justice framework programme. #NP# Regarding the objective included in the present programme of providing information and preventing the use of drugs, enhanced cooperation with third countries is necessary, as well as close coordination with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). This Lisbon-based agency was established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 of 8 February 1993[9] amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 3294/94 of 22 December 1994[10]. Its mission is to collect and disseminate objective, reliable and comparable information on drugs and drug addiction in Europe. In order to do so, it works in partnership with non-EU countries as well as international organisations dealing with this issue, notably: the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Council of Europe's Pompidou Group, the World Customs Organisation (WCO), the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) and the European Police Office (Europol). #NP# 3. RATIONALISATION AND SIMPLIFICATION #NP# 3.1. Transition from existing instruments #NP# The evaluation of the actions that the European Union has been supporting over the years in these areas fully recognises the need to continue as they tackle specific and real problems, and contribute to dealing with them in a positive way, complementary to national actions being developed in the same areas. However, it also identified several weaknesses that need to be faced so that European actions can achieve even better results. Indeed, the current situation, with a multitude of small scale budget lines or ad-hoc funding, with limited duration and no overall coherence, prevents Union activities from becoming efficient enough to achieve the objectives and to maximise the use of existing human and financial resources. Separate implementation of these programmes means that they do not maximise real synergies and may even create unnecessary overlaps. Finally, to achieve the best possible results there is a real need to reassess the objectives, the type of interventions and the scale of each programme. #NP# The proposed programme builds on the lessons learnt from existing actions in these fields. Indeed, it will largely develop the two existing preparatory actions on the protection and promotion of fundamental rights and on the support to civil society in the ten new Member States that will be extended to all Member States. Finally, special focus will be put on the fundamental rights stemming from the citizenship of the Union to encourage democratic participation. #NP# Further to the objective of promoting judicial cooperation, the programme will group together measures supporting cooperation in civil and criminal law to ensure a better coordination between these two areas of law in view of the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty which will abolish the pillar structure. Civil judicial cooperation has been previously supported through a separate programme, and judicial cooperation in criminal matters was part of the AGIS programme. The current proposal aims at an improved response to the political expectations of strengthening justice, as requested by The Hague Programme, and to demands from judicial authorities, legal practitioners and civil society in general. Training of the judiciary will be reinforced, and the programme will also have the necessary flexibility to allow for the implementation of new measures, such as the computerised system of exchange of information on criminal records. #NP# As regards combating violence, the programme will build on the existing Daphne II programme, with adjustments to improve the response to the demands from civil society, including the possibility of implementing new forms of action. Action on drugs prevention and information aims at consolidating ongoing actions under different programmes thus increasing transparency among citizens and all the actors involved. It will support the monitoring and evaluation of actions regarding the implementation of specific actions under the EU Action Plans, and seek a greater involvement of civil society. #NP# 3.2. Common management arrangements #NP# A key objective of the Fundamental Rights and Justice framework programme is to simplify and rationalise instruments both in legal and management terms, to streamline the budget structure, to increase coherence and consistency between programmes and to avoid duplication of instruments. The present programme represents an important step in what concerns both simplification and flexibility. Indeed, the number of budgetary lines and legal instruments has been reduced. This concentration of Union resources offers a higher financial transparency and the possibility to better assess the added value of the Union actions. It maximises the performance by increased consistency between the objectives of the different specific programmes and by strengthened cooperation and partnership with all actors involved. #NP# The proposed simplification and rationalisation will benefit the end users as it will increase the visibility, clarity and coherence of the instruments. Potential beneficiaries will find it easier to apply for funding under the different fields thanks to a more standardised approach and implementing provisions. #NP# The programme will be managed directly by the Commission. Alternative delivery mechanisms (externalisation or shared management) have been examined in detail but were not considered to be cost-effective at this stage given the relatively small amounts involved. If necessary to achieve the objectives put forward under the framework programme, the setup of different ways of management or /and different structures might be envisaged. #NP# The level of human resources required for the management of the programme is necessarily relatively high. However, the harmonisation of the procedures obtained by the integration of the specific programmes into a single structure will allow for a rationalisation from this point of view, due to economies of scale. For example, the rationalisation of the monitoring and evaluation procedures will allow for better outcomes and will facilitate transfer of good practices. Having a single Committee across the four specific programmes will also greatly facilitate the day-to-day management of the framework programme. #NP# Further rationalisation is possible after the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty. The framework programme was drafted according to the provisions of the present Treaties but a smooth transition to the new structure foreseen by the Constitution has been built into the structure of the programme, with further harmonisation possible between the specific Civil and Criminal Justice Programmes. #NP# 4. FINANCIAL RESOURCES #NP# The overall amount foreseen for the Fundamental Rights and Justice framework programme is EUR 543 million for the period 2007-2013 (current prices). Within this budget, EUR 93.8 million are foreseen for the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship programme, EUR 106.5 million for the Civil Justice programme, EUR 196.2 million for the Criminal Justice programme, and EUR 135.4 million for the programme Fight against Violence (Daphne) and Drugs Prevention and Information. Within the reference amount, EUR 11.1 million are added for administrative expenditure. #NP# In addition, covering the same period, an amount of EUR 164.9 million is foreseen for the Fundamental Rights Agency, an amount of EUR 110.6 million is foreseen for the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drugs Addiction, while the amount foreseen for Eurojust is EUR 133.4 million. #NP# These amounts have been estimated on the basis of the needs identified and described above. Relevant experience drawn from existing actions and programmes related to fundamental rights and justice issues has been taken into account. #NP# 5. CONCLUSIONS #NP# The new financial perspectives provide not only the opportunity for a better match between objectives and resources but also for simplifying and rationalising the instruments to ensure the optimal use of European Union funds. #NP# The Fundamental Rights and Justice framework programme brings together specific programmes that are closely linked with each other. Concerted actions within these specific programmes will enable a more efficient response to the ultimate objective, which is the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. #S#  #S# ANNEX #NP# Establishing a framework programme on Fundamental Rights and Justice for the period 2007-2013 #NP# Complementarity with agencies and other instruments in the area of Freedom, Security and Justice #NP# Several complementary instruments are forecast under the Financial Perspectives to contribute to the achievement of the policy objectives set in the area of Justice, Freedom and Security: #NP# - The framework programmes that will replace the multitude of budget lines that the Commission currently manages in this field ; #NP# - Community financing of agencies and Community or Union bodies ; #NP# - Development and management of related large scale information systems. #NP# The following agencies or bodies related to the area of the above framework programme are to be covered under the new financial perspectives: #NP# - European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), established by the Council Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 of 8 February 1993 on the establishment of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (OJ L 36, 12.2.1993, p. 1), last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1651/2003 (OJ L 245, 29.9.2003, p. 30) and for which a draft amending proposal is tabled (Proposal for a Council regulation, submitted by the Commission on 19 December 2003, on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (COM(2003) 808). #NP# - Observatory on Racism and Xenophobia , which is to become a fully fledged Agency on Fundamental Rights (Commission proposal planned for May 2005), and which is currently established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1035/97 of 2 June 1997 establishing a European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (OJ L 151, 10.6.1997, p. 1). #NP# - Eurojust, established by Council Decision 2002/187/JHA of 28 February 2002 setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious organised crime (OJ L 63, 6.3.2002, p. 1), as last amended by Decision 2003/659/JHA (OJ L 245, 29.9.2003, p. 44). #NP# On the basis of the elements above, the budgetary resources for the above community agencies, are not included in the framework programmes. #NP# They must, however, be included as part of the expenditure dedicated to JLS policy in the Heading 3 of the future Community financial framework. #NP# EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM #NP# 1. CONTEXT #NP# The preparation of the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 has been guided from the outset by a policy-led approach, in order to ensure consistency between political objectives and the amounts allocated to pursue them. In this context, the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice is considered to be one of the main priorities of the European Union for the years to come, to be supported through substantially increased financial means. In its Communications ¬´ Building our common Future - Policy challenges and Budgetary means of the Enlarged Union 2007-2013 ¬ª[11] and ¬´ Financial Perspectives 2007 ‚Äì 2013 ¬ª[12], the Commission also underlined the importance of using the revision of the legal instruments for the next financial perspectives to create a significant movement towards greater simplicity. Structuring its proposals around three general and policy-led programmes (‚ÄúSolidarity and management of migration flows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù, ‚ÄúSecurity and safeguarding freedoms‚Äù), the Commission sets out a clear framework for the development of financial interventions of the Community in support of the three objectives of Justice, Freedom and Security. #NP# 2. Justification of the action #NP# 2.1. Analysis of the problem #NP# The fight against violence clearly forms part of the protection of fundamental rights as set out in the Charter, in particular the right to physical integrity. The links between violence and several other fundamental rights (liberty, security, health, employment, etc.) are so strong that the implementation of these rights in general as they concern the physical integrity of individuals should be supported. Specific forms of violence ‚Äì such as racially-motivated violence and violence related to gender or sexual preference ‚Äì require specific responses which would benefit from European-level exchange of information and development of best practice. The need for a more global and pertinent solution to problems of violence has to be taken into account when designing a response under the new financial perspectives, starting from existing intervention. #NP# The establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice should also tackle drug use and trafficking, one of the main issues facing European societies. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary and integrated strategy has been put forward since 1990 at European level, but without a clearly identified means of financial support. This strategy is based on five main elements: (i) reducing demand, (ii) reducing supply and combating illicit trafficking, (iii) international co-operation, (iv) co-ordination at national and EU level and (v) information research and evaluation. #NP# 2.2. The way forward #NP# The main challenges facing the Union in relation to tackling drugs over the period of the next financial perspectives can be defined as follows: #NP# - information and research, including the continuation of the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA); #NP# - drug demand reduction since demand feeds the growth of the drugs phenomenon: education, prevention and harm-reduction programmes; #NP# - drug supply reduction, to stop trafficking and drug-related criminality, in particular as regards new synthetic drugs and their chemical precursors, as well as combating money-laundering; #NP# - enhanced cooperation with third countries concerning drug supply and drug demand reduction; #NP# - further legislative activity will be needed in line with new and developing forms of drugs, for example to bring new forms of drugs under established control mechanisms. #NP# 2.3. Objectives of the programme and related indicators #NP# - Definition of general, specific and operational objectives #NP# To contribute to the setting up of an area of freedom, security and justice by combating violence and by informing on and preventing drug use. | To protect citizens against violence and to attain a high level of health protection, well being and social cohesion. | To prevent and combat all forms of violence occurring in the public or the private domain, against children, young people and women To provide support for victims and groups at risk. To assist and encourage NGO and other organisations active in this field. To disseminate the results obtained under the two Daphne programmes including their adaptation, transfer and use by other beneficiaries or in other geographical areas. To identify and enhance actions contributing to the positive treatment of people at risk of violence. | #NP# To prevent and reduce drug use, dependence and drug related harms. | To involve civil society in the implementation and development of the European Union‚Äôs Drugs Strategy and Action plans. To monitor, implement and evaluate the implementation of specific actions under the Drugs Action Plans 2005 ‚Äì 2008 and 2009 ‚Äì 2012. | #NP# To promote transnational and awareness-raising actions in the areas identified above. | To set up multidisciplinary networks; to ensure the expansion of the knowledge base, the exchange of information and the identification and dissemination of good practice, including through training, study visits and staff exchange. To develop and implement awareness-raising actions targeted at specific audiences to promote the adoption of zero tolerance towards violence and to encourage support for victims and the reporting of violence. To raise awareness of the health and social problems caused by drug use and to encourage an open dialogue with a view to promoting a better understanding of the drug phenomenon. | #NP# All the objectives are consistent with the overall aim of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù to support the development of an area of freedom, security and justice. #NP# - Complementarity/coherence with other instruments #NP# When preparing the programme, particular attention was given to ensure coherence with other programmes financing activities in the same policy areas and to looking for complementarity and synergy with these. #NP# This programme is complemented by the other specific programmes under the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù in particular the specific programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Citizenship‚Äù that seeks to promote the European Union fundamental rights and values while preserving and respecting the diversity of the culture and traditions of the peoples of Europe. #NP# Complementarity will also be sought with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction that has as main mission to collect and disseminate objective, reliable and comparable information on the phenomenon of drugs and drug addiction in Europe. In order to do so, the Centre works in partnership with non-EU countries as well as with international organisations concerned with this issue. #NP# The general programmes ‚ÄúSecurity and Safeguarding Liberties‚Äù and ‚ÄúSolidarity and Management of Migration Flows‚Äù will be given special attention as they complement the present programme and synergy with the two will certainly be achieved in particular in the area of fighting against crime be it violence such as racially-motivated violence and violence related to gender or sexual preference or drugs related crimes. #NP# Other programmes may also complement the present programme such ‚ÄúSafer Internet Plus‚Äù, ‚ÄúHealth programme‚Äù, ‚ÄúInjury Protection Programme‚Äù the 7th Research %amp% Development Framework Programme and the ‚ÄúYouth‚Äù programme. #NP# 3. EVALUATION #NP# 3.1. Lessons drawn from intermediate / final evaluations #NP# The Daphne programme was assessed twice by the Commission. A mid term report was presented in 2002[13] and a final report in 2004[14]. #NP# Both the mid term and final reports on the Daphne programme (2000‚Äì2003) show that organisations have gained from their participation in European partnership, enabling associations to work together resulted in more effective programming and better use of resources. The final report indicated that there was some room for improvement such as the creation of a helpdesk and putting increased emphasis on dissemination, and the Daphne II programme was adapted in line with the findings of this report. As these changes to the structure of the programme are quite recent, no significant changes need to be introduced. #NP# The Action Plan on Drugs (2000‚Äì2004) was evaluated by the Commission on two occasions: at mi-term[15] and at the end of the programme[16]. The new Action Plan (2005-2008) targets in particular those areas that the evaluation highlighted as needing to be progressed further. #NP# According to these evaluations some improvements need to be made in order better to achieve the objectives. In particular, it was emphasised that civil society should be further involved in the preparation and development of EU policies in this area. Better coordination of national actions, including in the international arena is also required. Networking and exchange of best practices should be encouraged and further developed. #NP# 3.2. Ex ante evaluation #NP# The working paper of the Commission presenting the ex ante evaluation of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù shows the appropriateness of the policy option chosen to achieve the goals envisaged. #NP# 4. LEGAL BASIS AND RATIONALE OF THE POLICY INSTRUMENT #NP# 4.1. Legal Basis #NP# This specific programme of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù is based in Article 152 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. #NP# Article 152 TEC, which relates to public health, clearly states that the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities shall ensure a high level of protection of human health. It adds that the Community shall complement the Member States‚Äô action in reducing drugs-related health damage, including through information and prevention. #NP# Ensuring a high level of human health by protecting people against violence and developing informative and preventive action in respect of drugs is the main objectives of this programme. The legal basis proposed is therefore adequate. #NP# 4.2. Actions defined within the programme #NP# Different types of actions are envisaged such as: #NP# - Specific actions taken by the Commission, such as, studies and research, opinion polls and surveys, formulation of indicators and common methodologies, collection, development and dissemination of data and statistics, seminars, conferences and expert meetings, organisation of public campaigns and events, development and maintenance of websites, preparation and dissemination of information material, support for and management of networks of national experts, analytical, monitoring and evaluation activities; #NP# - Actions providing financial support for specific projects of Community interest under the conditions set out in the annual work programmes; #NP# - Actions providing financial support for the activities of non-governmental organisations or other entities under the conditions set our in the annual work programmes; #NP# - An operating grant to the European Federation for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children which pursues an aim of general European interest in the field of children‚Äôs rights and protection. #NP# 4.3. Subsidiarity and Proportionality #NP# The current proposal has been designed to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty and its accompanying Protocol. So far as subsidiarity is concerned, this programme does not attempt to intervene in the areas that are cover by national programmes developed by national authorities in each Member State but to focus on areas where European added-value can be engendered. To this extent, the great majority of the activities supported by the programme can be viewed as complementary to national actions and as attempting to exploit as far as possible the synergy from actions implemented at international and regional level. #NP# As far as proportionality is concerned, the new programme proposal has been designed to incorporate the maximum possible simplification in terms not only of the form of the action ‚Äì the definitions of actions in the legislative text are kept as generic as possible ‚Äì but also in terms of the administrative and financial requirements that will apply to their implementation. The Commission has sought to find the right balance between flexibility and ease of use on the one hand, and clarity of purpose and appropriate financial and procedural safeguards, on the other. #NP# Following the guidelines indicated in the protocol on the application of both principles, it is clear that the problems that this programme sought to tackle have transnational aspects and therefore that action at Community level will yield benefits over and above action at Member State level. #NP# 4.4. Simplification and rationalisation #NP# The proposed approach will contribute to the key objective of simplifying instruments both in legal and management terms and of streamlining of the structure of the budget. It will also increase coherence and consistency between instruments and avoid duplication between these. Whilst additional human resources will be necessary to cope with future enlargements, a better allocation of human resources will be achieved by discontinuing smaller budget lines (which absorb disproportionate resources) and by regrouping existing programmes into a single, coherent and streamlined programme. This will result in more proportionality between the amount of expenditure and the administrative cost of managing it. #NP# The proposed rationalisation will also benefit the end-user as it increases the visibility, clarity and coherence of the instruments. Potential beneficiaries will find it easier to apply for funding thanks to the standardised approach and the harmonisation of provisions for implementation. #NP# The Commission may decide to entrust part of the budget implementation to agencies governed by Community law, referred to in Article 54(2)(a) of the Financial Regulation. These agencies shall be designated by the Commission in conformity with the provisions of Articles 55 and 56 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and of Article 37 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002. The Commission shall analyse the compliance with the principles of economy, effectiveness and efficiency. Before proceeding to implement the delegation, the Commission shall ensure, by mean of a prior assessment that the creation of agencies is in compliance with sound financial management. #NP# The proposed new instrument follows the path that was determined by the Commission in what concerns the political and financial challenges as from 2007 on. The intention is to complement, simplify and rationalise the existing instruments and to ensure the necessary flexibility to face new objectives and to respond in a smooth way to the new legal framework, which will be established once the Constitutional Treaty enters into force. #NP# 5. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS #NP# The cost of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù for the period 2007‚Äì2013 is EUR 543 million; the present specific programme will be allocated EUR 138.2 million. #NP# 2005/0037 (COD) #NP# Proposal for a #NP# DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL #NP# Establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme ""Fight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information"" as part of the General programme ""Fundamental Rights and Justice"" #NP# THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 152 thereof, #NP# Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[17], #NP# Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[18], #NP# Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[19], #NP# Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[20], #NP# Whereas: #NP# (1) The Treaty establishing the European Community establishes that in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities a high level of human health has to be ensured; Article 3(1)(p) of the Treaty requires Community action to include a contribution to the attainment of a high level of health protection. #NP# (2) Community action should complement national policies directed towards improving public health, obviating sources of danger to human health and reducing health-related harm associated with drug dependence. #NP# (3) Physical, sexual and psychological violence against children, young people and women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life, constitute a breach of their right to life, safety, freedom, dignity and physical and emotional integrity and a serious threat to the physical and mental health of the victims of such violence. The effects of such violence, being so widespread throughout the Community, constitute a genuine health scourge and an obstacle to the enjoyment of safe, free and just citizenship. #NP# (4) The World Health Organisation defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. According to a 1996 World Health Assembly resolution violence is a leading worldwide public health problem. In its report on violence and health of 3 October 2002 the organisation recommends promoting primary prevention responses, strengthening responses for victims of violence and increasing collaboration and exchange of information on violence prevention. #NP# (5) These principles are recognised in numerous conventions, declarations and protocols of the main international organisations and institutions such as the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation, the World Conference on Women and the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. #NP# (6) The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union[21] reaffirms, inter alia, the rights to dignity, equality and solidarity. It includes a number of specific provisions to protect and promote physical and mental integrity, equal treatment for men and women, the rights of the child and non-discrimination, as well as to prohibit inhuman or degrading treatment, slavery and forced labour, and child labour. It reaffirms that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities. #NP# (7) The Commission has been called upon by the European Parliament to draw up and implement action programmes to combat such violence, inter alia, in its Resolutions of 19 May 2000 on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament. ‚ÄòFor further actions in the fight against trafficking in women'[22], and of 20 September 2001 on female genital mutilation[23]. #NP# (8) The action programme set up by Decision No 293/2000/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 January 2000 adopting a programme of Community action (the Daphne programme) (2000 to 2003) on preventive measures to fight violence against children, young people and women[24] has helped increase awareness within the European Union and increase and consolidate cooperation between organisations in the Member States active in combating violence. #NP# (9) The action programme set up by Decision No 803/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 adopting a programme of Community action (2004 to 2008) to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk (the Daphne II programme)[25] further developed the results already achieved by the Daphne programme; according to Article 8(2) thereof the Commission shall take the necessary steps to ensure the consistency of the annual appropriations with the new financial perspectives. #NP# (10) It is desirable to ensure continuity for the projects supported by the Daphne and the Daphne II programmes. #NP# (11) Given that, according to research, the morbidity and the mortality associated with drug dependence affects a sizeable number of European citizens, the health-related harm associated with drug dependence constitutes a major problem for public health. #NP# (12) The Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the results of the final evaluation of the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan on Drugs (2000-2004)[26] pointed out the need to regularly involve civil society in the formulation of the EU‚Äôs policies on drugs. #NP# (13) The Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council adopting a programme of action in the field of public health (2003‚Äì2008) includes the development of strategies and measures on drug dependence, as one of the important lifestyle-related health determinants. #NP# (14) In its Recommendation of 18 June 2003 on the prevention and reduction of health-related harm associated with drug dependence[27], the Council recommended that Member States set as a public health objective the prevention of drug dependence and the reduction of related risks, and that they develop and implement comprehensive strategies accordingly. #NP# (15) In December 2004 the European Council endorsed the European Union Drugs Strategy 2005‚Äì2012 that covers all European Union drug-related activities and sets main targets. These targets include the attainment of a high level of health protection, well-being and social cohesion by preventing and reducing drug use, dependence and drug-related harms to health and society. #NP# (16) The Commission adopted its Action Plan on Drugs 2005‚Äì2008[28] as a crucial instrument for transposing the European Union Drugs Strategy 2005‚Äì2012 into concrete actions. The ultimate aim of the Action Plan is to significantly reduce the prevalence of drug use among the population and to reduce the social harm and health damage caused by the use of and trade in illicit drugs. #NP# (17) It is important and necessary to recognise the serious immediate and long-term implications of violence and drugs for health, psychological and social development, and for the equal opportunities of those concerned, for individuals, families and communities, and the high social and economic costs to society as a whole. #NP# (18) The European Union can bring added value to the actions to be undertaken by Member States in the field of drugs information and prevention by complementing those actions and by promoting synergies. #NP# (19) Concerning the prevention of violence, including abuse and sexual exploitation perpetrated against children, young people and women and the protection of victims and groups at risk, the European Union can bring added value to the actions predominantly to be undertaken by Member States by the following means: the dissemination and exchange of information, experience and good practices; the promotion of an innovative approach; the joint establishment of priorities; the development of networking as appropriate; the selection of Community-wide projects; and the motivation and mobilisation of all parties concerned. These actions should also encompass children and women brought to the Member States through human trafficking. #NP# (20) The European Federation for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children groups together at European level different NGOs dealing with the problem of the disappearance and sexual exploitation of children. The Federation raises awareness and fights against the phenomena of missing and sexually exploited children by facilitating communication between European organisations towards a more efficient approach, stimulating the creation of a European study centre to centralise and analyse data concerning these phenomena and promoting and conducting activities to improve the situation of minors, victims of disappearance and/or sexual abuse, and to change the legal norms, the mentality and behaviour in Europe. #NP# (21) The objectives of the proposed action, namely to prevent and combat all forms of violence against children, young people and women and drugs prevention and information cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the need for an exchange of information at EU level and for the Community-wide dissemination of good practices. This can be better achieved at Community level. Due to the need for a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach and by reason of the scale or impact of the initiative, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. #NP# (22) Appropriate measures should also be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used. #NP# (23) This Decision establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme, which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure[29]. #NP# (24) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[30], hereinafter ‚Äúthe Financial Regulation‚Äù, and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002[31], which safeguard the Community‚Äôs financial interests, have to be applied, taking into account the principles of simplicity and consistency in the choice of budgetary instruments, a limitation on the number of cases where the Commission retains direct responsibility for their implementation and management, and the required proportionality between the amount of resources and the administrative burden related to their use. #NP# (25) The Financial Regulation requires a basic act to be provided to cover operating grants. #NP# (26) In accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[32] measures for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted by use of the advisory procedure provided for in Article 3 of that Decision. This is appropriate since the programme does not have a significant impact on the Community budget. #NP# HAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: #NP# Article 1 Creation of the programme #NP# 1. This Decision establishes the programme ‚ÄúFight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information‚Äù, hereinafter referred to as ""the programme"", as part of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù, in order to contribute to the strengthening of the area of Freedom, Security and Justice. #NP# 2.

CONTEXT #NP# The preparation of the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 has been guided from the outset by a policy-led approach, in order to ensure consistency between political objectives and the amounts allocated to pursue them. In this context, the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice is considered to be one of the main priorities of the European Union for the years to come, to be supported through substantially increased financial means. In its Communications ¬´ Building our common Future - Policy challenges and Budgetary means of the Enlarged Union 2007-2013 ¬ª[33] and ¬´ Financial Perspectives 2007 ‚Äì 2013 ¬ª[34], the Commission also underlined the importance of using the revision of the legal instruments for the next financial perspectives to create a significant movement towards greater simplicity. Structuring its proposals around three general and policy-led programmes (‚ÄúSolidarity and management of migration flows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù, ‚ÄúSecurity and safeguarding freedoms‚Äù), the Commission sets out a clear framework for the development of financial interventions of the Community in support of the three objectives of Justice, Freedom and Security. #NP# 2. JUSTIFICATION OF THE ACTION #NP# 2.1. Analysis of the problem #NP# The promotion of European Union citizenship should develop a feeling of belonging to a union that shares fundamental rights and values while preserving and respecting the diversity of the culture and traditions of the peoples of Europe. The Treaty establishing the European Community establishes European citizenship and the rights and duties of EU citizens; and the Treaty on European Union, together with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, is the basis for the EU policy in respect of fundamental rights. #NP# The main challenges facing the Union in relation to this policy area over the period of the next financial perspectives can be defined as follows: #NP# 1. The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union into the Constitutional Treaty, the opening of the way for the Union to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights, and the Article 7 TEU monitoring mechanisms already put in place under the Nice Treaty together imply a significant reinforcement and operationalisation of the fundamental values which are at the heart of the European project. #NP# 2. Following the incorporation of the Charter into the Constitutional Treaty, the Union will be legally obliged not only to respect these rights, but, subject to respect of the principle of subsidiarity, also to ensure that they are effectively promoted in all policy areas (both internal and external) for which the Union is competent. #NP# 3. Monitoring activities to ensure that the Member States adopt the same approach in their areas of competence will increase dramatically, particularly in the context of a growing and ever more diverse Union and the new challenges that this will bring. #NP# 4. NGOs and other civil society actors play an important role in promoting and protecting fundamental rights throughout the European Union and in helping people to get to know their rights and to exercise them fully. It is therefore essential to ensure that the level of action and commitment from those entities is equivalent in all Member States. Supporting civil society and promoting networking is therefore essential. #NP# 5. Promoting of an interfaith and multi-cultural dialogue that can be seen as an important means for fighting against discrimination and promoting fundamental rights, mutual understanding and peace. #NP# 2.2. The way forward #NP# The aim of this specific programme of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù is to develop significantly the two existing preparatory actions (promotion of fundamental rights and support of civil society) introducing new objectives such as the fight against racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism namely through the promotion of an inter-faith and a multicultural dialogue at EU level. #NP# The support of civil society in respect of fundamental rights will be enlarged to cover all Member States while the present preparatory action only covers the ten new Member States. #NP# A special focus will be put on the rights deriving from citizenship of the Union, recognised as fundamental rights by the Charter, namely to encourage democratic participation. #NP# A significant increase in the financial envelope is planned to reflect the increasing importance of these issues and to respond positively to civil society actors. #NP# 2.3. Objectives of the programme and related indicators #NP# - Definition of general, specific and operational objectives #NP# To promote the development of a European society based on European Union citizenship and respectful of fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. | To promote the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to inform citizens of their rights as Union citizens and to encourage them to participate actively in the democratic life of the Union. | To support awareness-raising actions. | #NP# To assess regularly the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union and its Member States, within the scope of Community law, using the Charter of Fundamental Rights as the guiding document and to obtain opinions on specific questions related to fundamental rights when necessary. | To prepare regular reports or opinions on the situation of fundamental rights in the EU. | #NP# To explain the consequences of the insertion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitution and of the European Union‚Äôs accession to the European Convention of Human Rights. | To support information campaigns in these fields. | #NP# To fight against anti-semitism, racism and xenophobia and to strengthen civil society in the field of fundamental rights | To support NGO and other bodies from civil society to enhance their capability to participate actively in the promotion of fundamental rights. To fight against anti-semitism, racism and xenophobia by promoting a better understanding and improved tolerance throughout the European Union. To promote peace and fundamental rights namely through an interfaith and multicultural dialogue at EU level. | To have open, transparent and regular dialogue with civil society in respect of fundamental rights. To support awareness-raising actions. To provide financial support for the activities of non-governmental organisations or other entities pursuing the general European interest. To undertake studies and analyses in these areas. | #NP# All the objectives are consistent with the overall aim of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù to support the development of an area of freedom, security and justice. #NP# - Complementarity/coherence with other instruments #NP# This programme will actively seek complementarity with the future of Fundamental Rights Agency, built upon the existing European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, to avoid overlaps and ensure synergy. #NP# This programme is complemented by the other specific programmes under the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù in particular the specific programme ‚ÄúFight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information‚Äù that aims at fighting against violence which clearly forms part of the protection of fundamental rights as set out in the Charter, in particular the right to physical integrity, and at tackling drug use and trafficking. #NP# The general programmes ‚ÄúSecurity and Safeguarding Liberties‚Äù and ‚ÄúSolidarity and Management of Migration Flows‚Äù will be given special attention as they complement the present programme and synergy will certainly be achieved. Particular attention will be given to the dialogue with migrants to foster tolerance and mutual understanding thus helping integrate third country nationals. #NP# Attention was also given to other programmes, particularly the programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (PROGRESS) and the programme on active citizenship, in order to avoid overlaps and to ensure coherence and complementarity in particular in what concerns the actions supported by the present programme that might have positive consequences on the fight against discrimination and on the promotion of an intercultural dialogue. #NP# Complementarity will be sought during the implementation of the programmes, to coordinate the activities undertaken under each one of them when necessary. #NP# 3. EVALUATION #NP# 3.1. Lessons drawn from intermediate/final evaluations #NP# Two existing preparatory actions aim at promoting the fundamental rights and at supporting to civil society. #NP# The first preparatory action on fundamental rights funds at the moment two different projects: an annual report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union and its Member States prepared by a network of independent experts, and funding of projects aiming at informing all persons residing in the European Union about the Charter of Fundamental Rights and at raising awareness about fundamental rights in the context of Union Law. #NP# The second preparatory action aims at supporting civil society in the Member States which acceded to the European Union on 1st May 2004. #NP# Even if the preparatory actions are too recent to allow for a proper assessment, the enthusiastic participation of civil society confirms the need to set up a structured programme to ensure continuation of those activities on a larger scale. #NP# Furthermore, regular contacts maintained with civil society confirm that an open and regular dialogue with NGOs in the area of fundamental rights should be further developed and highlighted the need for more awareness raising campaigns on fundamental rights and also the need to promote networking between NGOs from different Member States. #NP# 3.2. Ex ante evaluation #NP# The working paper of the Commission presenting the ex ante evaluation of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù shows the appropriateness of the policy option chosen to achieve the goals envisaged. #NP# 4. LEGAL BASIS AND RATIONALE OF THE POLICY INSTRUMENT #NP# 4.1. Legal Basis #NP# This specific programme of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù is based in Article 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. #NP# This Article foresees that an action by the Community is possible even if no powers are specifically envisaged in the Treaty if the action concerned is necessary to attain one of the objectives of the Community. #NP# The objectives of this programme do not have a specific legal basis in the Treaty, since they concern promotion of the fundamental rights of the Charter generally and not merely promotion of the few specific fundamental rights for which specific legal bases exist. They will nevertheless contribute to the definition and implementation of EU competencies and policies by raising awareness among everyone in the European Union of their fundamental rights under Community law #NP# The legal basis proposed is appropriate as the programme contributes to attain Community objectives. #NP# 4.2. Actions defined within the programme #NP# Different types of actions are envisaged such as: #NP# - specific actions taken by the Commission, such as, studies and research, opinion polls and surveys, formulation of indicators and common methodologies, collection, development and dissemination of data and statistics, seminars, conferences and expert meetings, organisation of public campaigns and events, development and maintenance of websites, preparation and dissemination of information material, support for and management of networks of national experts, analytical, monitoring and evaluation activities; #NP# - actions providing financial support for specific projects of Community interest under the conditions set out in the annual work programmes; #NP# - actions providing financial support for the activities of non-governmental organisations or other entities under the conditions set our in the annual work programmes; #NP# - an operating grant to the Association of the Council of States and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union which pursues an objective of general European interest by promoting exchanges of views and experience on matters concerning the jurisprudence, organisation and functioning of its Members in the performance of their judicial and/or advisory functions, particularly with regard to Community Law. #NP# 4.3. Subsidiarity and Proportionality #NP# The current proposal has been designed to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty and its accompanying Protocol. So far as subsidiarity is concerned, this programme does not attempt to intervene in the areas that are cover by national programmes developed by national authorities in each Member State but to focus on areas where European added-value can be engendered. To this extent, the great majority of the activities supported by the programme can be viewed as complementary to national actions and as attempting to exploit as far as possible the synergy from actions implemented at international and regional level. #NP# So far as proportionality is concerned, the new programme proposal has been designed to incorporate the maximum possible simplification in terms not only of the form of the action ‚Äì the definitions of actions in the legislative text are kept as generic as possible ‚Äì but also in terms of the administrative and financial requirements that will apply to their implementation. The Commission has sought to find the right balance between flexibility and ease of use on the one hand, and clarity of purpose and appropriate financial and procedural safeguards, on the other. #NP# Following the guidelines indicated in the protocol on the application of both principles, it is clear that the problems that this programme sought to tackle have transnational aspects and therefore that action at Community level will yield benefits over and above action at Member State level. #NP# 4.4. Simplification and rationalisation #NP# The proposed approach will contribute to the key objective of simplifying instruments both in legal and management terms and of streamlining of the structure of the budget. It will also increase coherence and consistency between instruments and avoid duplication between these. Whilst additional human resources will be necessary to cope with future enlargements, a better allocation of human resources will be achieved by discontinuing smaller budget lines (which absorb disproportionate resources) and by regrouping existing programmes into a single, coherent and streamlined programme. This will result in more proportionality between the amount of expenditure and the administrative cost of managing it. #NP# The proposed rationalisation will also benefit the end-user as it increases the visibility, clarity and coherence of the instruments. Potential beneficiaries will find it easier to apply for funding thanks to the standardised approach and the harmonisation of provisions for implementation. #NP# The Commission may decide to entrust part of the budget implementation to agencies governed by Community law, referred to in Article 54(2)(a) of the Financial Regulation. These agencies shall be designated by the Commission in conformity with the provisions of Articles 55 and 56 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and of Article 37 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002. The Commission shall analyse the compliance with the principles of economy, effectiveness and efficiency. Before proceeding to implement the delegation, the Commission shall ensure, by mean of a prior assessment that the creation of agencies is in compliance with sound financial management. #NP# The proposed new instrument follows the path that was determined by the Commission in what concerns the political and financial challenges as from 2007 on. The intention is to complement, simplify and rationalise the existing instruments and to ensure the necessary flexibility to face new objectives and to respond in a smooth way to the new legal framework, which will be established once the Constitutional Treaty enters into force. #NP# 5. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS #NP# The cost of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù for the period 2007‚Äì2013 is EUR 5439 million; the present specific programme will be allocated EUR 96.5 million. #NP# 2005/0038 (CNS) #NP# Proposal for a #NP# COUNCIL DECISION #NP# Establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme ""Fundamental rights and citizenship"" as part of the General programme ""Fundamental Rights and Justice"" #NP# THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof, #NP# Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[35], #NP# Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[36], #NP# Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[37], #NP# Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[38], #NP# Whereas: #NP# (1) Article 6(1) on the Treaty on European Union states that the Union is founded on the principle of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States. #NP# (2) Article 6(2) on the Treaty on European Union states that the Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law. #NP# (3) The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which was proclaimed on 7 December 2000, embraces the fundamental values on which the European Union is founded[39]. #NP# (4) As stated in The Hague Programme adopted by the European Council at its meeting in Brussels on 4 and 5 November 2004, the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will place the European Union under a legal obligation to ensure, subject to respect of the principle of subsidiarity, that in all areas of its activity, fundamental rights are not only respected but also actively promoted. #NP# (5) In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union[40], the Commission underlines the importance of the role that civil society plays both in protecting and promoting fundamental rights; the Commission therefore should establish a regular dialogue with civil society. #NP# (6) The Commission stresses the importance of the information and communication with respect to the rights that European Union citizenship confers on its citizens to improve their awareness of their rights and to provide them with easy access to reliable information. #NP# (7) In November 2004 the European Council recognised the importance of communication to bring all persons close to the European project by encouraging an active citizenship. #NP# (8) The Association of the Council of States and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union promotes exchanges of views and experience on matters concerning the jurisprudence, organisation and functioning of its Members in the performance of their judicial and/or advisory functions, particularly with regard to Community Law and therefore pursues an aim of general European interest. #NP# (9) The Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Decision, powers than those under Article 308. #NP# (10) Appropriate measures should also be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used. #NP# (11) This Decision establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme, which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure[41]. #NP# (12) The objectives of the programme, namely in the field of promotion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights including those derived from the EU citizenship , the support to civil society associations, the fight against racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism through an interfaith and multicultural dialogue cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or impact of the initiative, be better achieved at Community level. The Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives. #NP# (13) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[42], hereinafter ‚Äúthe Financial Regulation‚Äù, and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002[43], which safeguard the Community‚Äôs financial interests, have to be applied taking into account the principles of simplicity and consistency in the choice of budgetary instruments, a limitation on the number of cases where the Commission retains direct responsibility for their implementation and management, and the required proportionality between the amount of resources and the administrative burden related to their use. #NP# (14) The Financial Regulation requires a basic act to be provided to cover operating grants. #NP# (15) In accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[44] measures for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted by use of the advisory procedure provided for in Article 3 of that Decision. This is appropriate since the programme does not have a significant impact on the Community budget. #NP# HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: #NP# Article 1 #NP# Creation of the programme #NP# 1.

CONTEXT #NP# The preparation of the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 has been guided from the outset by a policy-led approach, in order to ensure consistency between political objectives and the amounts allocated to pursue them. In this context, the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice is considered to be one of the main priorities of the European Union for the years to come, to be supported through substantially increased financial means. In its Communications ¬´ Building our common Future - Policy challenges and Budgetary means of the Enlarged Union 2007-2013 ¬ª[45] and ¬´ Financial Perspectives 2007‚Äì2013 ¬ª[46], the Commission also underlined the importance of using the revision of the legal instruments for the next financial perspectives to create a significant movement towards greater simplicity. Structuring its proposals around three general and policy-led programmes (‚ÄúSolidarity and management of migration flows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù, ‚ÄúSecurity and safeguarding freedoms‚Äù), the Commission sets out a clear framework for the development of financial interventions of the Community in support of the three objectives of Justice, Freedom and Security. #NP# 2. JUSTIFICATION OF THE ACTION #NP# 2.1. Analysis of the problem #NP# The right to move freely within the Union (one of the four principles underlying the Single Market), requires measures in respect of criminal law to ensure that there are no safe havens for crime and criminals.. #NP# Common EU interests must be protected against criminal behaviour, either because of its cross-border dimension, or because it offends EU common values, such as respect for individuals, democracy and good governance (which explains why action against sexual exploitation of children, racism, fraud and corruption is necessary). A common approach in this regard reflects the emergence of a European public order. Yet it must also take account of the need to provide a high standard of protection of individual rights, which means, for example, building on earlier achievements in respect of the rights of the victims, improving the rights of people arrested and setting the framework and standards regarding the way sentences are served and offenders are reintegrated into society. Indeed, individuals and businesses should not be prevented or discouraged from exercising their rights by the incompatibility or complexity of legal and administrative systems in the Member States #NP# 2.2. The way forward #NP# The promotion and the protection of fundamental rights require the establishment of a genuine European area of justice. The creation of such an area enables judicial authorities to co-operate effectively, and ensures that citizens have a better access to justice and are neither prevented nor discouraged from exercising their rights by incompatibilities and complexities in legal systems. It also enables the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions to be established, and the good functioning of the judiciary to be continuously improved. #NP# The challenge for the Union will be to respond to the expectations of the citizens that there should be effective solutions to their practical problems. This will imply in particular: #NP# - as the acquis grows, increased efforts to monitor its application by the Member States, including through such modern means as the establishment of databases of case law; #NP# - further legislative action in particular to improve ease of access to and the efficiency of justice; #NP# - strengthening of mechanisms for providing information to the public and promoting training of and exchanges of practitioners on the implications of the instruments for cooperation in this area; #NP# - legislative measures to put in place and develop common tools for cooperation. This implies inter alia, on the one hand, more efficient mechanisms for exchange of information between Member States on those convicted of criminal activities, in particular by setting up a computerised system to exchange information on criminal records, and on the other hand, to improve standards for certain procedures such as rules on collection of evidence and on the protection of those involved in criminal proceedings, whether they are the accused, witnesses or victims; #NP# - further measures to promote understanding and use of common tools and procedures among practitioners. #NP# 2.3. Objectives of the programme and related indicators #NP# - Definition of general, specific and operational objectives #NP# To promote judicial cooperation with the aim of contributing to the creation of a genuine European area of justice in criminal matters based on mutual recognition and mutual confidence. | To promote the adaptation of the existing judicial systems in Member States to the European Union being a territory without border controls, with a single currency, with free movement of persons, services, goods and capital. | To improve mutual knowledge of Member States‚Äô legal and judicial systems in criminal matters and to promote and strengthen networking, mutual cooperation, exchange and dissemination of information, experience and best practices. To ensure the sound implementation, the correct and concrete application and the evaluation of Community instruments in the areas of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. | #NP# To improve the daily life of individuals and businesses by enabling them to assert their rights throughout the European Union, notably by fostering access to justice. | To improve information on the legal systems in the Member States and access to justice. | #NP# To improve the contacts between legal, judicial and administrative authorities and the legal professions, to improve exchange of information on criminal cases between Member States and to foster the training of the members of the judiciary. | To promote the training of the judiciary and judicial staff in Union matters. To evaluate the general conditions necessary to develop mutual confidence, including the quality of justice. To develop and implement a European computerised system of exchange of information on criminal records and to support studies to develop other types of exchange of information. | #NP# All the objectives are consistent with the overall aim of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù to support the development of an area of freedom, security and justice. #NP# - Complementarity/coherence with other instruments #NP# When preparing the programme, particular attention was given to ensuring coherence with other programmes financing activities in the same policy areas and to looking for complementarity and synergy with these. #NP# This programme is complemented by the other specific programmes under the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù in particular the specific programme ‚ÄúCivil Justice‚Äù on judicial cooperation in civil matters. The ‚ÄúCivil Justice‚Äù programme follows, as much as possible, the objectives and the structure of the present programme and aims at ensuring that the right to move freely within the Union is not prevented or discouraged by the complexity of the legal and administrative systems of the Member States. #NP# Complementarity will also be sought with Eurojust which is a European Union body established to enhance the effectiveness of the competent authorities within Member States when they are dealing with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organised crime, including terrorism, by stimulating and improving cooperation between those authorities. By placing an emphasis on ensuring full cooperation between the competent national authorities, Eurojust is an essential complement to the Fundamental Rights and Justice programme in particular the specific programme ‚ÄúCriminal Justice‚Äù. #NP# Complementarity is also to be ensured with the general programme ‚ÄúSecurity and Safeguarding Liberties‚Äù that puts the emphasis on law enforcement, in the sense of cooperation between police and other non-judicial law enforcement agencies, while the presente programme focuses on the judiciary. #NP# Finnally complementarity will also be sought with the general programme ‚ÄúSolidarity and Management of Migration Flows‚Äù in particular in the area related to the asylum and third country national integration legal systems. #NP# 3. EVALUATION #NP# 3.1. Lessons drawn from intermediate/final evaluations #NP# Although an in-depth evaluation of the AGIS programme is still under way, it can be said that this programme turned out to be very useful and has contributed considerably to improve mutual understanding among national authorities and institutions. The first annual report on the implementation of the programme underlines that the high number of proposals received, which were more than the budget available, shows clearly the interest in the programme among its potential beneficiaries, It also highlights that conferences and seminars are by far the most important type of action and they account for almost half (46.4%) of the total number of projects co-financed. The second most important type (26.8% of the total) concerns research, studies and the establishment of networks. Training and exchange programmes, which are by their nature more difficult to implement than these other actions, represent a fifth (20.5%) of the number of projects co-financed. #NP# 3.2. Ex ante evaluation #NP# The working paper of the Commission presenting the ex ante evaluation of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù shows the appropriateness of the policy option chosen to achieve the goals envisaged. #NP# 4. LEGAL BASIS AND RATIONALE OF THE POLICY INSTRUMENT #NP# 4.1. Legal Basis #NP# This specific programme of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù is based in Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union. #NP# This Article indicates the contents of the common action on judicial cooperation in criminal matters. #NP# Article 34(2)(c) of Treaty on European Union determines that the Council may adopt decisions in respect of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. #NP# The legal basis proposed is appropriate as the programme is targeted at judicial cooperation in criminal matters #NP# 4.2. Actions defined within the programme #NP# Different types of actions are envisaged such as: #NP# - specific actions taken by the Commission, such as, studies and research, creation and implementation of specific projects like the creation of a computerised system of exchange of information on criminal records, opinion polls and surveys, the formulation of indicators and common methodologies, collection, development and dissemination of data and statistics, seminars, conferences and expert meetings, organisation of public campaigns and events, development and maintenance of websites, preparation and dissemination of information material, support for and management of networks of national experts, analytical, monitoring and evaluation activities; #NP# - actions providing financial support for specific projects of Community interest under the conditions set out in the annual work programmes; #NP# - actions providing financial support for the activities of non-governmental organisations or other entities under the conditions set our in the annual work programmes; #NP# - an operating grant to the European Judicial Training Network which pursues an aim of general European interest in the field of training of the judiciary. #NP# 4.3. Subsidiarity and Proportionality #NP# The current proposal has been designed to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty and its accompanying Protocol. So far as subsidiarity is concerned, this programme does not attempt to intervene in the areas that are cover by national programmes developed by national authorities in each Member State but to focus on areas where European added-value can be engendered. To this extent, the great majority of the activities supported by the programme can be viewed as complementary to national actions and as attempting to exploit as far as possible the synergy from actions implemented at international and regional level. #NP# So far as proportionality is concerned, the new programme proposal has been designed to incorporate the maximum possible simplification in terms not only of the form of the action ‚Äì the definitions of actions in the legislative text are kept as generic as possible ‚Äì but also in terms of the administrative and financial requirements that will apply to their implementation. The Commission has sought to find the right balance between flexibility and ease of use on the one hand, and clarity of purpose and appropriate financial and procedural safeguards, on the other. #NP# Following the guidelines indicated in the protocol on the application of both principles, it is clear that the problems that this programme sought to tackle have transnational aspects and therefore that action at Community level will yield benefits over and above action at Member State level. #NP# 4.4. Simplification and rationalisation #NP# The proposed approach will contribute to the key objective of simplifying instruments both in legal and management terms and of streamlining of the structure of the budget. It will also increase coherence and consistency between instruments and avoid duplication between these. Whilst additional human resources will be necessary to cope with future enlargements, a better allocation of human resources will be achieved by discontinuing smaller budget lines (which absorb disproportionate resources) and by regrouping existing programmes into a single, coherent and streamlined programme. This will result in more proportionality between the amount of expenditure and the administrative cost of managing it. #NP# The proposed rationalisation will also benefit the end-user as it increases the visibility, clarity and coherence of the instruments. Potential beneficiaries will find it easier to apply for funding thanks to the standardised approach and the harmonisation of provisions for implementation. #NP# The Commission may decide at a later stage to entrust part of the budget implementation to agencies governed by Community law, referred to in Article 54(2) (a) of the Financial Regulation. These agencies shall be designated by the Commission in conformity with the provisions of Articles 55 and 56 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and of Article 37 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002. The Commission shall analyse the compliance with the principles of economy, effectiveness and efficiency. Before proceeding to implement the delegation, the Commission shall ensure, by mean of a prior assessment that the creation of agencies is in compliance with sound financial management. #NP# The proposed specific programme follows the path that was determined by the Commission in what concerns the political and financial challenges as from 2007 on. The intention is to complement, simplify and rationalise the existing instruments and to ensure the necessary flexibility to face new objectives and to respond in a smooth way to the new legal framework, which will be established once the Constitutional Treaty enters into force. #NP# 5. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS #NP# The cost of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù for the period 2007‚Äì2013 is EUR 543 million; the present specific programme will be allocated EUR 199 million. #NP# 2005/0039 (CNS) #NP# Proposal for a #NP# COUNCIL DECISION #NP# Establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme ""Criminal justice"" as part of the General programme ""Fundamental Rights and Justice"" #NP# THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 31 and Article 34(2)(c) thereof, #NP# Having regard to the proposal of the Commission[47], #NP# Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[48], #NP# Whereas: #NP# (1) Article 29 of the Treaty of the European Union states that the Union‚Äôs objective is to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. #NP# (2) According to Article 31 of the Treaty of the European Union, common action in criminal matters shall include, in particular, cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States. #NP# (3) Building on the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, The Hague Programme, adopted by the European Council in November 2004, reaffirms the priority in strengthening Freedom, Security and Justice in the European Union, in particular by enhancing judicial cooperation in criminal matters, based on the mutual recognition principle. #NP# (4) The framework programme on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (AGIS) established by Council Framework Decision 2002/630/JHA of 22 July 2002[49] contributed considerably to strengthening cooperation between police and other law enforcement agencies and the judiciary in the Member States and to improving mutual understanding and mutual trust of their police, judicial, legal and administrative systems. #NP# (5) The ambitious objectives set by the Treaty and The Hague Programme should be realised through the establishment of a flexible and effective programme that will facilitate planning and implementation. #NP# (6) The programme should improve mutual confidence within the judiciary. Mutual confidence, according to the Hague programme, should be strengthened by developing networks of judicial organisation and institutions, by improving training of judicial professions, by developing the evaluation of the implementation of EU instruments including evaluation of the quality of justice, by increasing research in the field of judicial cooperation, and by facilitating operational projects among Member States aiming at modernising justice. It should also facilitate the implementation of the mutual recognition principle by improving mutual knowledge on previous convictions passed in the European Union, in particular through the creation of a computerised system of exchange of information on criminal records. #NP# (7) The European Judicial Training Network founded by institutions specifically responsible for the training of the professional judiciary of all Member States promotes a training programme for judges and public prosecutors with a genuine European dimension. This contributes to strengthening the mutual confidence and improves mutual understanding among judicial authorities and different legal systems. #NP# (8) Appropriate measures should also be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used. #NP# (9) This Decision establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme, which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure[50]. #NP# (10) Since the objectives of the Criminal Justice Programme cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the initiative, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. #NP# (11) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[51], hereinafter ‚Äúthe Financial Regulation‚Äù, and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002[52], which safeguard the Community‚Äôs financial interests, have to be applied taking into account the principles of simplicity and consistency in the choice of budgetary instruments, a limitation on the number of cases where the Commission retains direct responsibility for their implementation and management, and the required proportionality between the amount of resources and the administrative burden related to their use. #NP# (12) The Financial Regulation requires a basic act to be provided to cover operating grants. #NP# (13) The measures required to implement this Decision should be adopted according to the procedures laid down in it, with the assistance of an advisory committee. This is appropriate since the programme does not have a significant impact on the budget of the European Union. #NP# (14) It is appropriate to replace the framework programme on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (AGIS) by this programme from 1 January 2007 and by the new specific programme ‚ÄúPrevention of and fight against crime‚Äù from the general programme ‚ÄúSecurity and Safeguarding Liberties‚Äù. #NP# HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: #NP# Article 1 #NP# Creation of the programme #NP# 1.

CONTEXT #NP# The preparation of the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 has been guided from the outset by a policy-led approach, in order to ensure consistency between political objectives and the amounts allocated to pursue them. In this context, the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice is considered to be one of the main priorities of the European Union for the years to come, to be supported through substantially increased financial means. In its Communications ¬´ Building our common Future - Policy challenges and Budgetary means of the Enlarged Union 2007-2013 ¬ª[53] and ¬´ Financial Perspectives 2007‚Äì2013 ¬ª[54], the Commission also underlined the importance of using the revision of the legal instruments for the next financial perspectives to create a significant movement towards greater simplicity. Structuring its proposals around three general and policy-led programmes (‚ÄúSolidarity and management of migration flows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù, ‚ÄúSecurity and safeguarding freedoms‚Äù), the Commission sets out a clear framework for the development of financial interventions of the Community in support of the three objectives of Justice, Freedom and Security. #NP# 2. JUSTIFICATION OF THE ACTION #NP# 2.1. Analysis of the problem #NP# The internal market is a reality, and it has resulted in increased exchanges between the Member States of the Union. It has given rise to an increase in the frequency with which European citizens move to or perform economic activities and buy goods and services in other Member States sometimes through the use of modern technologies. Furthermore, personal and family situations with a cross-border dimension (eg marriages between people of different nationality, people owning houses in another Member State) are also more frequent. Action is needed to ensure that litigants can have easy access to effective justice in such cases. Problems that are likely to increasingly arise in the future, such as issues relating to the status of unmarried couples, claims to property on the break-up of marriages or other relationships an well as in other circumstances, personal status (names), or adoption, also need to be covered. Indeed, individuals and the business sector should not be prevented or discouraged from exercising their rights by the incompatibility or complexity of legal and administrative systems in the Member States. #NP# 2.2. The way forward #NP# The promotion and the protection of fundamental rights require the establishment of a genuine European area of justice. The creation of such an area enables judicial authorities to co-operate effectively, and ensures that citizens have a better access to justice and are neither prevented nor discouraged from exercising their rights by incompatibilities and complexities in legal systems. It also enables the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions to be established, and the good functioning of the judiciary to be continuously improved. #NP# The challenge for the Union will be to respond to the expectations of the citizens that there should be effective solutions to their practical problems. This will imply in particular: #NP# - as the acquis grows, increased efforts to monitor its application by the Member States, including through such modern means such as the establishment of databases of case law; #NP# - further legislative action in particular to improve the ease of access to and the efficiency of justice; #NP# - strengthening of mechanisms for providing information to the public and promoting training and exchanges of practitioners on the implications of the instruments for cooperation in this area; #NP# - further measures to promote understanding and use of common tools and procedures among practitioners. #NP# 2.3. Objectives of the programme and related indicators #NP# - Definition of general, specific and operational objectives #NP# To promote judicial cooperation with the aim of contributing to the creation of a genuine European area of justice in civil matters based on mutual recognition and mutual confidence. . | To promote the adaptation of the existing judicial systems in Member States to the European Union being a territory without border controls, with a single currency, with free movement of persons, services, goods and capital. | To improve mutual knowledge of Member States‚Äô legal and judicial systems in civil matters and to promote and strengthen networking, mutual cooperation, exchange and dissemination of information, experience and best practices. To ensure the sound implementation, the correct and concrete application and the evaluation of Community instruments in the areas of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. | #NP# To improve the daily life of individuals and businesses by enabling them to assert their rights throughout the European Union, notably by fostering access to justice. | To improve information on the legal systems in the Member States and access to justice. | #NP# To improve the contacts between legal, judicial and administrative authorities and the legal professions, and to foster the training of the members of the judiciary. | To promote the training of the judiciary and judicial staff in Community matters. To evaluate the general conditions necessary to develop mutual confidence, including the quality of justice. To support the operational work of the European judicial network in civil and commercial matters created by Council Decision 2001/470/CE of 28 May 2001. | #NP# All the objectives are consistent with the overall aim of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù to support the development of an area of freedom, security and justice. #NP# - Complementarity/coherence with other instruments #NP# When preparing the programme, particular attention was given to ensuring coherence with other programmes financing activities in the same policy areas and to looking for complementarity and synergy with these. #NP# This programme is complemented by the other specific programmes under the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù in particular the specific programme ‚ÄúCriminal Justice‚Äù on judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The ‚ÄúCriminal Justice‚Äù programme follows, as much as possible, the objectives and the structure of the present programme and aims at ensuring that the right to move freely within the Union is not prevented or discouraged by the complexity of the legal and administrative systems of the Member States. #NP# Complementarity is also to be ensured with the general programmes ‚ÄúSecurity and Safeguarding Liberties‚Äù and ‚ÄúSolidarity and Management of Migration Flows‚Äù to achieve synergy in particular in the area related to the asylum and third country national integration legal systems. #NP# 3. EVALUATION #NP# 3.1. Lessons drawn from intermediate/final evaluations #NP# The Commission adopted a mid-term report[55] on the general Community framework of activities to facilitate the implementation of judicial cooperation in civil matters. The report admits that two years of implementation of the programme are not enough to make an in-depth analysis of it; even so, it enables a first set of conclusions to be reached. #NP# It is recognised that the actions developed by the Commission ‚Äì the European Judicial Atlas in Civil Matters, the database in case law under Brussels I and Brussels II regulations and an information campaign to inform legal practitioners about judicial cooperation in civil matters within the European Union ‚Äì were very well received and that they should be continued. #NP# The European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters, established to improve, simplify and expedite effective judicial cooperation between Member States in civil and commercial matters is also an important Commission activity and its importance is clearly recognised. #NP# On the other hand, some problems were detected as regards the projects presented and implemented by civil society. The fact that the budget available was limited prevented the presentation of sizeable projects in specific areas such as the training and exchange of judges. The dissemination of the results needs also to be further improved. #NP# Civil society should be encouraged to participate more in Commission activities in specific areas mainly as regards information to citizens and enterprises. #NP# Finally, it is important to focus on the multiplier effects of the actions by identifying the target groups carefully. #NP# 3.2. Ex ante evaluation #NP# The working paper of the Commission presenting the ex ante evaluation of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù shows the appropriateness of the policy option chosen to achieve the goals envisaged. #NP# 4. LEGAL BASIS AND RATIONALE OF THE POLICY INSTRUMENT #NP# 4.1. Legal Basis #NP# This specific programme of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù is based in Article 61(c) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. #NP# This Article states that in order to establish progressively an area of freedom, security and justice, the Council shall adopt measures in respect of judicial cooperation in civil matters; Article 67(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community determines the procedure to be used when adopting such measures. #NP# The legal basis proposed is appropriate as the programme is targeted at judicial cooperation in civil matters #NP# 4.2. Actions defined within the programme #NP# Different types of action are envisaged such as: #NP# - specific actions taken by the Commission, such as, studies and research, opinion polls and surveys, formulation of indicators and common methodologies, collection, development and dissemination of data and statistics, seminars, conferences and expert meetings, organisation of public campaigns and events, development and maintenance of websites, preparation and dissemination of information material, support for and management of networks of national experts, analytical, monitoring and evaluation activities; #NP# - actions providing financial support for specific projects of Community interest under the conditions set out in the annual work programmes; #NP# - actions providing financial support for the activities of non-governmental organisations or other entities under the conditions set our in the annual work programmes. #NP# 4.3. Subsidiarity and Proportionality #NP# The current proposal has been designed to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty and its accompanying Protocol. So far as subsidiarity is concerned, this programme does not attempt to intervene in the areas that are cover by national programmes developed by national authorities in each Member State but to focus on areas where European added-value can be engendered. To this extent, the great majority of the activities supported by the programme can be viewed as complementary to national actions and as attempting to exploit as far as possible the synergy from actions implemented at international and regional level. #NP# So far as proportionality is concerned, the new programme proposal has been designed to incorporate the maximum possible simplification in terms not only of the form of the action ‚Äì the definitions of actions in the legislative text are kept as generic as possible ‚Äì but also in terms of the administrative and financial requirements that will apply to their implementation. The Commission has sought to find the right balance between flexibility and ease of use on the one hand, and clarity of purpose and appropriate financial and procedural safeguards, on the other. #NP# Following the guidelines indicated in the protocol on the application of both principles, it is clear that the problems that this programme sought to tackle have transnational aspects and therefore that action at Community level will yield benefits over and above action at Member State level. #NP# 4.4. Simplification and rationalisation #NP# The proposed approach will contribute to the key objective of simplifying instruments both in legal and management terms and of streamlining of the structure of the budget. It will also increase coherence and consistency between instruments and avoid duplication between these. One example is the inclusion within the programme of previously separate actions for promoting training of judges in the specific field of European competition law. Whilst additional human resources will be necessary to cope with future enlargements, a better allocation of human resources will be achieved by discontinuing smaller budget lines (which absorb disproportionate resources) and by regrouping existing programmes into a single, coherent and streamlined programme. This will result in more proportionality between the amount of expenditure and the administrative cost of managing it. #NP# The proposed rationalisation will also benefit the end-user as it increases the visibility, clarity and coherence of the instruments. Potential beneficiaries will find it easier to apply for funding thanks to the standardised approach and the harmonisation of provisions for implementation. #NP# The Commission may decide to entrust part of the budget implementation to agencies governed by Community law, referred to in Article 54(2) (a) of the Financial Regulation. These agencies shall be designated by the Commission in conformity with the provisions of Articles 55 and 56 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and of Article 37 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002. The Commission shall analyse the compliance with the principles of economy, effectiveness and efficiency. Before proceeding to implement the delegation, the Commission shall ensure, by mean of a prior assessment that the creation of agencies is in compliance with sound financial management. #NP# The proposed new instrument follows the path that was determined by the Commission in what concerns the political and financial challenges as from 2007 on. The intention is to complement, simplify and rationalise the existing instruments and to ensure the necessary flexibility to face new objectives and to respond in a smooth way to the new legal framework, which will be established once the Constitutional Treaty enters into force. #NP# 5. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS #NP# The cost of the general programme ‚ÄúFundamental rights and Justice‚Äù for the period 2007 ‚Äì 2013 is EUR 543 million; the present specific programme will be allocated EUR 109.3 million. #NP# 2005/0040 (COD) #NP# Proposal for a #NP# DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL #NP# Establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme ‚ÄúCivil justice‚Äù as part of the General programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù #NP# THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 61(c) and Article 67(2) thereof, #NP# Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[56], #NP# Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[57], #NP# Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[58], #NP# Whereas: #NP# (1) The European Community has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured. To that end, the Community must adopt, among others, measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market. #NP# (2) Following previous programmes, such as Grotius[59] and the Robert Schuman[60] project, Council Regulation (EC) No 743/2002[61] established, for the period 2002 to 2006, a general Community framework of activities to facilitate the implementation of judicial cooperation in civil matters. #NP# (3) The European Council meeting in Brussels on 4 and 5 November 2004 adopted The Hague Programme ‚ÄúStrengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union‚Äù. #NP# (4) The ambitious objectives set by the Treaty and The Hague Programme should be realised through the establishment of a flexible and effective programme that will facilitate planning and implementation. #NP# (5) The Civil Justice Programme should provide for initiatives taken by the Commission, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, for actions in support of organisations promoting and facilitating judicial cooperation in civil matters, and for actions in support of specific projects. #NP# (6) A general Civil Justice Programme to improve mutual understanding of the legal and judicial systems of the Member States will contribute to lowering the barriers to judicial cooperation in civil matters, which will improve the functioning of the internal market. #NP# (7) Denmark, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, is not participating in the adoption of this Decision, which is not binding on Denmark nor applicable to it, #NP# (8) Appropriate measures should also be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used. #NP# (9) This Decision establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme, which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure[62]. #NP# (10) Since the objectives of the Civil Justice Programme cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the initiative, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. #NP# (11) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[63] hereinafter ‚Äúthe Financial Regulation‚Äù, and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002[64], which safeguard the Community‚Äôs financial interests, have to be applied taking into account the principles of simplicity and consistency in the choice of budgetary instruments, a limitation on the number of cases where the Commission retains direct responsibility for their implementation and management, and the required proportionality between the amount of resources and the administrative burden related to their use. #NP# (12) The Financial Regulation requires a basic act to be provided to cover operating grants. #NP# (13) In accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[65] measures for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted by use of the advisory procedure provided for in Article 3 of that Decision. This is appropriate since the programme does not have a significant impact on the Community budget. #NP# HAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: #NP# Article 1 #NP# Creation of the programme #NP# 1.

CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES #NP# 5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term #NP# 5.1.1. Civil Justice #NP# The promotion and the protection of fundamental rights demand the establishment of a genuine European area of justice. In such an area competent judicial authorities co-operate effectively, and citizens have a better access to justice and are neither prevented nor discouraged from exercising their rights by incompatibilities and complexities of the legal systems, judicial decisions circulate freely among the Member States on the basis of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions, and the good functioning of the judiciary is constantly improved. #NP# The challenge for the Union will be to respond to citizens‚Äô expectations for effective solutions to their practical problems. This will imply in particular: #NP# - as the acquis grows, increased efforts of monitoring of its application by the Member States, including through modern means such as databases of case law; #NP# - further legislative action to address the new issues mentioned above, and to improve the ease of access to and efficiency of justice; #NP# - a need to address mutual recognition in a wider sense, including recognition of decisions and documents other than those issued by judicial authorities; #NP# - strengthening of mechanisms for providing information to the public and promote training of and exchanges between practitioners on the implications of the instruments for cooperation in this area; #NP# - further measures to promote understanding and use of common tools and procedures amongst practitioners. #NP# 5.1.2. Criminal Justice #NP# The challenge for the Union will be to respond to citizens‚Äô expectations for effective solutions to their practical problems. This will imply in particular: #NP# - as the acquis grows, increased efforts of monitoring of its application by the Member States, including through modern means such as databases of case law; #NP# - further legislative action to address the new issues mentioned above, and to improve the ease of access to and efficiency of justice; #NP# - a need to address mutual recognition in a wider sense, including recognition of decisions and documents other than those issued by judicial authorities; #NP# - strengthening of mechanisms for providing information to the public and promote training of and exchanges between practitioners on the implications of the instruments for cooperation in this area; #NP# - legislative measures to put in place and develop common tools for cooperation. This implies inter alia on the one hand more efficient mechanisms of exchange of information between Member States on criminals, in particular on convicted persons by setting up a computerised mechanism to exchange information on criminal records, and on the other hand, to improve standards for certain procedures such as rules on evidence collection and rules on the protection of individuals involved in criminal proceedings, whether they are the accused, witnesses or victims; #NP# - further measures to promote understanding and use of common tools and procedures amongst practitioners. #NP# 5.1.3 Fundamental Rights and Justice #NP# The aim of this specific programme of the programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù is to develop significantly the two existing preparatory actions (promotion of fundamental rights and the support to civil society) introducing new objectives such as the fight against racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism namely through the promotion of an inter-faith and a multicultural dialogue at EU level. #NP# The support to civil society in the field of fundamental rights will be enlarged to cover all Member States while the present preparatory action only covers the ten new Member States. #NP# A special focus will be put on the rights deriving from the citizenship of the Union, recognised as fundamental rights by the Charter, namely to encourage democratic participation. #NP# A significant increase in the financial envelope is planned to reflect the increasing importance of these issues and to respond positively to civil society actors. #NP# 5.1.4 Fight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information #NP# The main challenges facing the Union in relation to tackling drugs over the period of the next financial perspectives can be defined as follows: #NP# - information and research, including the continuation of the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA); #NP# - drug demand reduction since demand feeds the growth of the drugs phenomenon: education, prevention and harm-reduction programmes; #NP# - drug supply reduction, to stop trafficking and drug-related criminality, in particular as concerns new synthetic drugs and their chemical precursors, as well as combating money-laundering; #NP# - enhanced cooperation with third countries concerning drug abuse control and drug demand reduction. #NP# - further legislative activity will be needed in line with new and developing forms of drugs, for example to bring new forms of drugs under established control mechanisms. #NP# Fight against violence (Daphne programme) #NP# The mid term and the final report on the Daphne programme (2000 ‚Äì 2003) show that organisations have gained from their participation in European partnerships. Bringing associations to work together resulted in more effective programming and better use of resources. #NP# The Daphne programme can thus be seen as successful in mobilising the civil society resulting in partnerships and alliances that are working together for more comprehensive European policies on violence. #NP# The final report of the Daphne programme (2000 ‚Äì 2003) revealed that there was some room to improvement such as the creation of a helpdesk and an increased focus on dissemination. The Daphne II programme was thus adapted to conform to the finding of that report. #NP# As these changes to the structure of the programme are quite recent, no significant changes need to be introduced. #NP# 5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy #NP# The European Union added value will be achieved by: #NP# - preparing the ground for the emergence of common strategies and legislation in this field; #NP# - implementing EU policy objectives and their application in national policies; #NP# - supporting the transposition of European Union legislation's and its application in a uniform way through Europe; #NP# - promoting the co-operation and co-ordination mechanisms between Member States; #NP# - cooperating with civil society organisations at European level. #NP# Criteria for evaluation #NP# A set of common evaluation criteria will be used through all specific programmes to evaluate the success of the interventions regarding the European Union added value in relation with the type of effect described above. Example of criteria could be: #NP# - To support only activities needed at European Union level to sustain European Union objectives, European Union laws and European Union implementation mechanism; #NP# - To support activities which will be complementary with those financed at national level; #NP# - To reinforce national exchanges at European Union level, generating synergy effects and economies of scale; #NP# - To involve actively Member States representatives and other relevant stakeholders in the implementation of the programme in order to maximise complementarities with existing activities. #NP# Subsidiarity and proportionality #NP# As far as subsidiarity is concerned the present programme focuses on areas where European added value can be demonstrated and therefore is designed to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty and its accompanying Protocol. #NP# As far as proportionality is concerned, the new programme proposal has been designed to incorporate the maximum feasible extent of simplification in terms not only of the form of the action but also in terms of the administrative and financial requirements that will apply to their implementation. The programme has been designed to strike to find the right balance between flexibility and ease of use on the one hand, and clarity of purpose and appropriate financial and procedural safeguards on the other. #NP# Complementarity with other Community interventions #NP# The present programme aims at contributing to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. A complementarity with other programmes may thus be possible. #NP# A non exhaustive list of areas of convergence can be mentioned: #NP# - The draft of the present programme took into account the Programme on Active Citizenship and the Youth programme to ensure that no overlap situations existed. In any case, particular attention will be paid to the implementation of those programmes to avoid such situations and to coordinate the results. #NP# - The draft of the present programme took into account the Programme for Employment and Social Security - PROGRESS to ensure that no overlap situations existed. Particular attention will be paid to the implementation of the programme to avoid such situations and to coordinate the results. #NP# - The current proposal is complementary to some actions under the 7th framework programme. Synergies will be actively promoted whenever possible, namely as regards the application of research results. #NP# - Special attention will be paid to the programmes implemented by in the field of Information Society, related with safe use of Internet and fighting its abuse, in particular as regards sensitive groups (e.g. children). #NP# - The current proposal will also seek to complement the work of EU Agencies active in these policy fields (EUMC, EMCDDA, Eurojust), as well as with the action of other international organisations acting in the field of fundamental rights, drugs action, fight against violence and judicial cooperation. #NP# Regular exchanges of information and active collaboration around projects under other Community programmes will take place, in order to improve and capitalise upon internal coherence, and between the Commission and other national and international authorities/organisations, to improve external coherence. #NP# Complementarities with interventions on Freedom, Security and Justice #NP# These interventions have a common goal of establishing an area of freedom, security and justice where basic human rights are respected. Each of the programmes is designed to address particular aspects which are a critical part of the creation of such an area in the EU, given the integration of national economies and the goal of ensuring free movement of people as well as goods, services and capital between countries. As such, they tackle issues affecting freedom, security and justice which arise from the creation of economic and monetary union and the abolition of internal borders and which can only be effectively addressed at EU level. These issues are to do with cooperation, harmonisation, coordination of activities, the exchange and sharing of critical information and best practices and techniques, and establishing solidarity mechanisms for sharing the costs involved in pursuing common and agreed objectives in an equitable way. #NP# They are reflected in the objectives set out in The Hague Programme adopted by the European Council in November 2004, which include: guarantying fundamental human rights throughout the EU, establishing minimum procedural safeguards and common access to justice, extending the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, fighting organised cross-border crime and the threat of terrorism, ensuring protection in accordance with international treaties to those in need, and regulating migration flows and controlling the external borders of the EU. Each of the programmes is aimed at pursuing these objectives in a complementary way without duplicating activities. #NP# The activities under the programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù, therefore, are designed to further fundamental human rights and ensure a common level of access to justice across the EU, and are accordingly complementary to activities under the other two programmes which reinforce this objective. In particular, they are directly complementary to the measures, under the Solidarity programme to improve the integration of migrants into EU society as well as to establish uniform procedures for dealing with asylum-seekers and, under the Security programme, to enhance protection of witnesses and victims of crime as well as to combat the trafficking of people. #NP# They are also complementary, if less directly, with activities under the Security programme to strengthen cooperation between police forces and law enforcement authorities as well as between bodies involved in combating the threat of terrorism. The freedom of EU citizens to enjoy their fundamental rights, therefore, is contingent on them feeling secure and being adequately protected against criminal activity or terrorist attack. #NP# 5.3.

Method of Implementation #NP# Show below the method(s) chosen for the implementation of the action. #NP# X Centralised Management #NP# X Directly by the Commission #NP# Ÿ±Indirectly by delegation to: #NP# Ÿ± Executive Agencies #NP# Ÿ± Bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation #NP# Ÿ± National public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission #NP# Ÿ± Shared or decentralised management #NP# Ÿ± With Member states #NP# Ÿ± With Third countries #NP# Ÿ± Joint management with international organisations (please specify) #NP# Relevant comments: #NP# In order to achieve the full objectives of the programme under the provisions of the Current Treaty, it has been decided to split into 4 legal instruments relating to 4 different legal bases. As stated in Mr. Vitorino‚Äôs Communication to the Commission (SEC(2004) 1195, 28.9.2004) the actions proposed are provided through the current Treaties. The legal bases required to establish the programmes have been limited in number as far as the current Treaties allow, while within and across the new programmes common delivery, management and implementation mechanisms are set in place. #NP# In order to achieve the general and specific and operational objectives, each programme within the programme ‚ÄúFundamental Rights and Justice‚Äù envisages a range of actions, such as: #NP# - Specific actions taken by the Commission, such as, studies and research, opinion polls and surveys, the formulation of indicators and common methodologies, collection, development and dissemination of data and statistics, seminars, conferences and experts meetings, organisation of public campaigns and events, development and maintenance of websites, preparation and dissemination of information materials, support to and animation of networks of national experts, analytical, monitoring and evaluation activities; #NP# - Actions providing financial support for specific projects of Community interest under the conditions set out in the annual work programmes; #NP# - Actions providing financial support for the activities of non-governmental organisations or other entities under the conditions set our in the annual work programmes; #NP# - Operative grants to entities identified in a legal basis. #NP# Methods of implementation: #NP# The above mentioned type of actions may be financed either by #NP# - A service contract following a call for tenders #NP# - A subsidy following a call for proposals. #NP# - Subsidies to a body pursuing an aim of general European interest, without a call for proposal. #NP# The Commission will implement the above actions in accordance with the annual work programme to be adopted. The Commission will implement this programme and may have recourse to technical and/or administrative assistance to the mutual benefit of the Commission and of the beneficiaries, for example to finance outside expertise on a specific subject. #NP# The Commission may decide to entrust part of the budget implementation to an executive agency, as referred to in Article 54, (2) (a) of the Financial Regulation. These agencies shall be designated by the Commission in conformity with the provisions of the Financial Regulation and more specifically with the principles of economy, effectiveness and efficiency. Before proceeding to implement the delegation, the Commission shall ensure, by mean of a prior assessment that the creation of agencies is in compliance with sound financial management. #NP# 6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION #NP# 6.1. Monitoring system #NP# A comprehensive monitoring system will be set-up in order to regularly follow up the implementation of the activities carried out under each specific programme. This system should allow for the collection of information relating to the financial implementation and to the physical outputs of the programme, across the types of action and the target groups included in the programme. The information will be collected at project level - indeed, for any action financed by the programme, the beneficiary shall submit technical and financial reports on the progress of the work, as well as a final report after the completion of the action. The precise configuration of the monitoring system, as well as the type of indicators to be set-up will be the object of further study in the process leading to the implementation of the programme. Indeed, a study on delivery mechanisms and related cost-effectiveness aspects is foreseen to take place during 2005. #NP# According to legal requirements and Commission‚Äôs evaluation policy, the programme will be evaluated at mid-term to assess its continuing relevance and draw useful lessons for the remainder of its implementation. A review of the programme may take place then, if considered necessary. A final evaluation will take place at the end of the programming period to assess the results of the programme and advise on its follow-up. These reports will be prepared under the responsibility of the Commission, and shall be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council. #NP# 6.2. Evaluation #NP# 6.2.1.

46,52005XC0806_05,en,2005,"Notice of initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of recordable digital versatile discs (DVD+/-R) originating in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan #NP# (This text replaces the one published in Official Journal C 191 of 5 August 2005, p. 11) #NP# (2005/C 192/07) #NP# The Commission has received a complaint pursuant to Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (""the basic Regulation"") [1], alleging that imports of recordable digital versatile discs (DVD+/-R), originating in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan (""the countries concerned""), are being dumped and are thereby causing material injury to the Community industry. #NP# 1. Complaint #NP# The complaint was lodged on 24 June 2005 by CECMA (""the complainant"") on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 60 %, of the total Community production of DVD+/-Rs. #NP# 2. Product #NP# The product allegedly being dumped is recordable digital versatile discs (DVD+/-R) originating in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan (""the product concerned""), normally declared within CN code ex85239000. This CN code is only given for information. #NP# 3. Allegation of dumping #NP# The allegation of dumping in respect of Taiwan is based on a comparison of normal value established on the basis of domestic prices, with the export prices of the product concerned when sold for export to the Community. #NP# The allegation of dumping for Hong Kong is based, in the absence of sufficient sales in the domestic market, on a comparison of a constructed normal value with the export prices of the product concerned when sold for export to the Community. #NP# In view of the provisions of Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation, the complainant established normal value for the People's Republic of China on the basis of a constructed normal value in a market economy country, which is mentioned in point 5.1(d).The allegation of dumping is based on a comparison of normal value, thus calculated, with the export prices of the product concerned when sold for export to the Community. #NP# On this basis, the dumping margins calculated are significant for all exporting countries concerned. #NP# 4. Allegation of injury #NP# The complainant has provided evidence that imports of the product concerned from the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have increased overall in absolute terms and in terms of market share. #NP# It is alleged that the volumes and the prices of the imported product concerned have, among other consequences, had a negative impact on the level of prices charged by the Community industry, resulting in substantial adverse effects on the overall performance and the financial situation of the Community industry. #NP# 5. Procedure #NP# Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that the complaint has been lodged by or on behalf of the Community industry and that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding, the Commission hereby initiates an investigation pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation. #NP# 5.1. Procedure for the determination of dumping and injury #NP# The investigation will determine whether the product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan is being dumped and whether this dumping has caused injury. #NP# (a) Sampling #NP# In view of the apparent large number of parties involved in this proceeding, the Commission may decide to apply sampling in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. #NP# (i) Sampling for exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan #NP# In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling is necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all exporters/producers, or representatives acting on their behalf, are hereby requested to make themselves known by contacting the Commission and providing the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6(b)(i) and in the format indicated in point 7 of this notice: #NP# - name, address, e-mail address, telephone, and fax, and/or telex numbers and contact person, #NP# - the turnover in local currency and the volume in units of the product concerned sold for export to the Community during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, #NP# - the turnover in local currency and the sales volume in units for the product concerned on the domestic market during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, #NP# - whether the company intends to claim an individual margin [2] (individual margins can only be claimed by producers), #NP# - the precise activities of the company with regard to the production of the product concerned, #NP# - the names and the precise activities of all related companies [3] involved in the production and/or selling (export and/or domestic) of the product concerned, #NP# - any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, #NP# - by providing the above information, the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample. If the company is chosen to be part of the sample, this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response. If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample, it will be deemed to not have co-operated in the investigation. The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below. #NP# In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for the selection of the sample of exporters/producers, the Commission will, in addition, contact the authorities of the exporting countries, and any known associations of exporters/producers. #NP# (ii) Sampling for importers #NP# In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling is necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all importers, or representatives acting on their behalf, are hereby requested to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6(b)(i) and in the formats indicated in point 7 of this notice: #NP# - name, address, e-mail address, telephone, and fax, and/or telex numbers and contact person, #NP# - the total turnover in euro of the company during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, #NP# - the total number of employees, #NP# - the precise activities of the company with regard to the product concerned, #NP# - the volume in units and value in euro of imports into and resales made in the Community market during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 of the imported product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, #NP# - the names and the precise activities of all related companies [3] involved in the production and/or selling of the product concerned, #NP# - any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, #NP# - by providing the above information, the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample. If the company is chosen to be part of the sample, this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response. If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample, it will be deemed to not have co-operated in the investigation. The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below. #NP# In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for the selection of the sample of importers, the Commission will, in addition, contact any known associations of importers. #NP# (iii) Final selection of the samples #NP# All interested parties wishing to submit any relevant information regarding the selection of the samples must do so within the time limit set in point 6(b)(ii). #NP# The Commission intends to make the final selection of the samples after having consulted the parties concerned that have expressed their willingness to be included in the sample. #NP# Companies included in the samples must reply to a questionnaire within the time limit set in point 6(b)(iii) and must cooperate within the framework of the investigation. #NP# If sufficient co-operation is not forthcoming, the Commission may base its findings, in accordance with Articles 17(4) and 18 of the basic Regulation, on the facts available. A finding based on facts available may be less advantageous to the party concerned, as explained in point 8. #NP# (b) Questionnaires #NP# In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the Community industry and to any association of producers in the Community, to the sampled exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, to any association of exporters/producers, to the sampled importers, to any association of importers named in the complaint, and to the authorities of the exporting countries concerned. #NP# Exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan claiming an individual margin, with a view to the application of Articles 17(3) and 9(6) of the basic Regulation, must submit a completed questionnaire within the time limit set in point 6(a)(ii) of this notice. They therefore have to request a questionnaire within the time limit set in point 6(a)(i). However, such parties should be aware that if sampling is applied to exporters/producers, the Commission may nonetheless decide not to calculate an individual margin for them, if the number of exporters/producers is so large that individual examination would be unduly burdensome and would prevent the timely completion of the investigation. #NP# (c) Collection of information and holding of hearings #NP# All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known, submit information other than questionnaire replies and to provide supporting evidence. This information and supporting evidence has to reach the Commission within the time limit set in point 6(a)(ii). #NP# Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. This request must be made within the time limit set in point 6(a)(iii). #NP# (d) Selection of the market economy country #NP# In accordance with Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, it is envisaged to choose Taiwan as an appropriate market economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People's Republic of China. Interested parties are hereby invited to comment on the appropriateness of this choice within the specific time limit set in point 6(c). #NP# (e) Market economy status #NP# For those exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China who claim and provide sufficient evidence that they operate under market economy conditions, i.e. that they meet the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, normal value will be determined in accordance with Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation. Exporters/producers intending to submit duly substantiated claims must do so within the specific time limit set in point 6(d). The Commission will send claim forms to all exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China named in the complaint and to any association of exporters/producers named in the complaint, where addresses are available, as well as to the authorities of the People's Republic of China. #NP# 5.2. Procedure for assessment of Community interest #NP# In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation and in the event that the allegations of dumping and injury caused thereby are substantiated, a decision will be reached as to whether the adoption of anti-dumping measures would not be against the Community interest. For this reason the Community industry, importers, their representative associations, representative users and representative consumer organisations, provided that they prove that there is an objective link between their activity and the product concerned, may, within the general time limits set in point 6(a)(ii), make themselves known and provide the Commission with information. The parties which have acted in conformity with the precedent sentence may request a hearing setting the particular reasons why they should be heard within the time limit set in point 6(a)(iii). It should be noted that any information submitted pursuant to Article 21 will only be taken into account if supported by factual evidence at the time of submission. #NP# 6. Time limits #NP# (a) General time limits #NP# (i) For parties to request a questionnaire or other claim forms #NP# All interested parties should request a questionnaire or other claim forms as soon as possible, but not later than 10 days after the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# (ii) For parties to make themselves known, to submit questionnaire replies and any other information #NP# All interested parties, if their representations are to be taken into account during the investigation, must make themselves known by contacting the Commission, present their views and submit questionnaire replies or any other information within 40 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, unless otherwise specified. Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the aforementioned period. #NP# Companies selected in a sample must submit questionnaire replies within the time limits specified in point 6(b)(iii). #NP# (iii) Hearings #NP# All interested parties may also apply to be heard by the Commission within the same 40 day time limit. #NP# (b) Specific time limit in respect of sampling #NP# (i) The information specified in points 5.1(a)(i) and 5.1(a)(ii) should reach the Commission within 15 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, given that the Commission intends to consult parties concerned that have expressed their willingness to be included in the sample on its final selection within a period of 21 days of the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# (ii) All other information relevant for the selection of the sample as referred to in 5.1(a)(iii) must reach the Commission within a period of 21 days of the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# (iii) The questionnaire replies from sampled parties must reach the Commission within 37 days from the date of the notification of their inclusion in the sample. #NP# (c) Specific time limit for the selection of the market economy country #NP# Parties to the investigation may wish to comment on the appropriateness of Taiwan which, as mentioned in point 5.1(d), is envisaged as a market economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People's Republic of China. These comments must reach the Commission within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# (d) Specific time limit for submission of claims for market economy status and/or for individual treatment #NP# Duly substantiated claims for market economy status (as mentioned in point 5.1(e)) and/or for individual treatment pursuant to Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation, must reach the Commission within 15 days of publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# 7. Written submissions, questionnaire replies and correspondence #NP# All submissions and requests made by interested parties must be made in writing (not in electronic format, unless otherwise specified) and must indicate the name, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax, and/or telex numbers of the interested party. All written submissions, including the information requested in this notice, questionnaire replies and correspondence provided by interested parties on a confidential basis shall be labelled as ""Limited [4]"" and, in accordance with Article 19(2) of the basic Regulation, shall be accompanied by a non-confidential version, which will be labelled ""For inspection by interested parties"". #NP# Commission address for correspondence: #NP# European Commission #NP# Directorate General for Trade #NP# Directorate B #NP# Office: J-79 5/16 #NP# B-1049 Brussels #NP# Fax (32-2) 295 65 05. #NP# 8. Non-cooperation #NP# In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available. #NP# Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated. #NP# 9. Schedule of the investigation #NP# The investigation will be concluded, according to Article 6(9) of the basic Regulation within 15 months of the date of the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. According to Article 7(1) of the basic Regulation, provisional measures may be imposed no later than 9 months from the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# [1] OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1, Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 461/2004 (OJ L 77, 13.3.2004, p. 12). #NP# [2] Individual margins may be claimed pursuant to Article 17(3) of the basic Regulation for companies not included in the sample, Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation concerning individual treatment in cases involving non-market economy countries/economies in transition, and Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation for companies claiming market economy status.

For the sake of clarity, Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 should be repealed and replaced. #NP# (2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 1037/72 of 18 May 1972 laying down general rules for granting and financing aid for hop producers [5], Council Regulation (EEC) No 1981/82 of 19 July 1982 drawing up the list of Community regions, in which production aid for hops is granted only to recognised producer groups [6], and Council Regulation (EEC) No 879/73 of 26 March 1973 on the granting and reimbursement of aid accorded by the Member States to recognised producer groups in the hop sector [7], which have become obsolete following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, should also be repealed. However, since Slovenia does not plan to apply the single payment scheme until 1 January 2007, provision should be made for Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 and Regulations (EEC) No 1037/72 and (EEC) No 1981/82 to continue to apply in Slovenia for the 2006 harvest. #NP# (3) Hops and vegetable saps and extracts of hops are products which are generally interchangeable. To enable the objectives of Article 33 of the Treaty to be achieved and ensure that the common agricultural policy has full effect in the hops sector, the measures on trade with third countries and the marketing rules adopted for hops should be extended to vegetable saps and extracts of hops. #NP# (4) To ensure a fair standard of living for producers, Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 lays down aid schemes for certain sectors, including hops. #NP# (5) A quality policy should be followed throughout the Community by implementing provisions concerning certification together with rules prohibiting, as a general rule, the marketing of products for which a certificate has not been issued or, in the case of imported products, those which do not comply with equivalent minimum quality characteristics. #NP# (6) To stabilise markets and ensure reasonable prices for supplies to consumers, centralisation of supply and the joint adaptation by growers of their produce to the requirements of the market should be encouraged. #NP# (7) To that end the grouping of growers in bodies which require their members to comply with certain common rules should further the achievement of the objectives of Article 33 of the Treaty. #NP# (8) To avoid any discrimination between producers and to ensure the unity and effectiveness of any action undertaken, conditions should be laid down, for the whole of the Community, with which producer groups must comply in order to be recognised by the Member States. To achieve an effective centralisation of supply, it is necessary in particular that the groups should be of an economically viable size and that the entire output of producers should be marketed either directly by the group or by the producers, according to common rules. #NP# (9) The measures envisaged should enable an import scheme to be provided for, based solely on application of the common customs tariff. #NP# (10) These measures should make it possible to waive all quantitative restrictions at the external frontiers of the Community. This procedure may, however, in exceptional cases, be found to be inadequate. In such cases, in order not to leave the Community market defenceless against any disturbances arising therefrom, the Community should be empowered to take all necessary measures quickly. These measures should be in accordance with the Community‚Äôs international obligations. #NP# (11) The proper functioning of the internal market would be compromised by the grant of national aid. As a result, the provisions of the Treaty governing State aid should apply to the products covered by this common market organisation. #NP# (12) The experience gained in the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 has revealed the need for instruments enabling preventive action to be taken where a risk of structural surpluses or market disturbance arises. #NP# (13) Adequate information is needed about the present state of the market within the Community and the prospects for its development. Provision should therefore be made for the registration of all contracts to supply hops produced within the Community. #NP# (14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [8]. #NP# (15) The transition from Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 to this Regulation is likely to create difficulties not envisaged in this Regulation. In order to deal with those difficulties, the Commission should be authorised to adopt transitional measures, #NP# HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: #NP# CHAPTER I #NP# SUBJECT MATTER AND DEFINITIONS #NP# Article 1 #NP# 1. A common organisation of the market in hops, including rules on marketing, producer groups and trade with third countries, is hereby established, covering the following products: #NP# CN code | Description of goods | #NP# 1210 | Hop cones, fresh or dried, whether or not ground, powdered or in the form of pellets; lupulin | #NP# 2. The rules of this Regulation on marketing and trade with third countries shall also apply to the following products: #NP# CN code | Description of goods | #NP# 13021300 | Vegetable saps and extracts of hops | #NP# Article 2 #NP# For the purposes of this Regulation: #NP# (a) ""hops"" means the dried inflorescences, also known as cones, of the (female) climbing hop plant (Humulus lupulus); these inflorescences, which are greenish yellow and of an ovoid shape, have a flower stalk and their longest dimension generally varies from 2 to 5 cm; #NP# (b) ""hop powder"" means the product obtained by milling the hops, containing all the natural elements thereof; #NP# (c) ""hop powder with higher lupulin content"" means the product obtained by milling the hops after mechanical removal of a part of the leaves, stalks, bracts and rachides; #NP# (d) ""extract of hops"" means the concentrated products obtained by the action of a solvent on the hops or on the hop powder; #NP# (e) ""mixed hop products"" means a mixture of two or more of the products referred to in points (a) to (d). #NP# Article 3 #NP# This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to the measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. #NP# CHAPTER II #NP# MARKETING #NP# Article 4 #NP# 1. The products referred to in Article 1, harvested or prepared within the Community, shall be subject to a certification procedure. #NP# 2. The certificate may be issued only for products having the minimum quality characteristics appropriate to a specific stage of marketing. In the case of hop powder, hop powder with higher lupulin content, extract of hops and mixed hop products, the certificate may only be issued if the alpha acid content of these products is not lower than that of the hops from which they have been prepared. #NP# 3. The certificate shall indicate at least: #NP# (a) the place(s) of production of the hops; #NP# (b) the year(s) of harvesting; #NP# (c) the variety or varieties. #NP# Article 5 #NP# 1. The products referred to in Article 1 may be marketed or exported only if the certificate referred to in Article 4 has been issued. #NP# In the case of imported products referred to in Article 1, the attestation provided for in Article 9(2) shall be deemed to be equivalent to the certificate. #NP# 2. Measures derogating from paragraph 1 may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 16(2): #NP# (a) in order to satisfy the trade requirements of certain third countries; or #NP# (b) for products intended for special uses. #NP# The measures provided for in the first subparagraph must: #NP# (a) not prejudice the normal marketing of products for which the certificate has been issued; #NP# (b) be accompanied by guarantees intended to avoid any confusion with those products. #NP# CHAPTER III #NP# PRODUCER GROUPS #NP# Article 6 #NP# For the purposes of this Regulation, ""producer group"" means a group consisting exclusively or, where national legislation allows, mainly of hop producers recognised by a Member State under Article 7 and formed on the initiative of the producers, in particular for the purpose of achieving one or more of the following objectives: #NP# (a) concentrating supply and helping to stabilise the market by marketing all the produce of the members or, if necessary, by purchasing hops at a higher price in accordance with Article 7(4)(a); #NP# (b) adapting such production jointly to the requirements of the market and improving the product, in particular by converting to other varieties, reorganising hop gardens, carrying out promotion, and conducting research into production, marketing and integrated protection; #NP# (c) promoting the rationalisation and mechanisation of cultivation and harvesting operations in order to render production more profitable and better protect the environment; #NP# (d) deciding what varieties of hops may be grown by its members and adopting common rules on production. #NP# Article 7 #NP# 1. The authority competent to recognise producer groups shall be the Member State within whose territory the producer group has its registered office. #NP# 2. Member States shall recognise producer groups which request recognition and fulfil the following general conditions: #NP# (a) they have legal personality or sufficient legal capacity to be subject, under national legislation, to rights and obligations; #NP# (b) they apply common rules for production and placing on the market (first stage of marketing); #NP# (c) their statutes include an obligation for producers who are members of groups to: #NP# (i) comply with the common rules on production and decisions on the varieties to be grown; #NP# (ii) market all their produce through the group; #NP# (d) they provide proof of economically viable activity; #NP# (e) they exclude throughout their field of activity any discrimination between Community producers or groups in respect of, in particular, their nationality or place of establishment; #NP# (f) they guarantee all producers who undertake to comply with the statutes, without discrimination, the right to belong to a group; #NP# (g) their statutes include provisions aimed at ensuring that the members of a group who wish to give up their membership may do so after having been a member for at least three years and provided that they inform the group of their intention at least one year before they leave, without prejudice to the national laws or regulations designed to protect, in specific cases, the group or creditors thereof against the financial consequences which might arise from a member leaving, or to prevent a member from leaving during the financial year; #NP# (h) their statutes include the obligation to keep separate accounts for the activities in respect of which they have been recognised; #NP# (i) they do not hold a dominant position in the Community. #NP# 3. The obligation provided for in paragraph 2(c) shall not apply to products covered by sales contracts concluded by producers before they joined the producer group, provided that the latter was informed of and approved such contracts. #NP# 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 2(c)(ii), where the producer group so authorises and under the conditions it lays down, members of a producer group may: #NP# (a) replace the obligation to have all their production marketed by the producer group provided for in paragraph 2(c)(ii) with marketing in accordance with common rules incorporated in the statutes, in order to ensure that the producer group has the right to monitor selling prices, which it must approve, failure to do so requiring the group to buy back the hops concerned at a higher price; #NP# (b) market, through the offices of another producer group chosen by their own group, products which by virtue of their characteristics are not necessarily covered by the commercial activities of the latter. #NP# CHAPTER IV #NP# TRADE WITH THIRD COUNTRIES #NP# Article 8 #NP# Save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation, the rates of import duty in the common customs tariff shall apply to the products listed in Article 1. #NP# Article 9 #NP# 1. The products referred to in Article 1 coming from third countries may be imported only if their quality standards are at least equivalent to those adopted for like products harvested within the Community or made from such products. #NP# 2. The products referred to in Article 1 shall be considered as being of the standard referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article if they are accompanied by an attestation issued by the authorities of the country of origin and recognised as equivalent to the certificate referred to in Article 4. #NP# In the case of hop powder, hop powder with higher lupulin content, extract of hops and mixed hop products, the attestation may only be recognised as being equivalent to the certificate if the alpha acid content of these products is not lower than that of the hops from which they have been prepared. #NP# The equivalence of these attestations shall be verified according to the procedure referred to in Article 16(2). #NP# Article 10 #NP# 1. The general rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and the special rules for its application shall apply to the tariff classification of products referred to in Article 1. The tariff nomenclature resulting from the application of this Regulation shall be incorporated in the common customs tariff. #NP# 2. Save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation or in provisions adopted under it, the following shall be prohibited in trade with third countries: #NP# (a) the levying of any charge having equivalent effect to a customs duty; #NP# (b) the application of any quantitative restriction or measure having equivalent effect. #NP# Article 11 #NP# 1. If, by reason of imports or exports, the Community market in one or more of the products listed in Article 1 is affected by, or is threatened with, serious disturbance likely to jeopardise the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 33 of the Treaty, appropriate measures may be applied in trade with non-member third countries of the World Trade Organisation until such disturbance or threat of it has ceased. #NP# 2. If the situation referred to in paragraph 1 arises, the Commission shall, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, decide upon the necessary measures. The Member States shall be notified of such measures, and shall be immediately applicable.

The security shall be released in proportion to the quantities delivered when the producer presents proof of delivery to a distillery. #NP# The security shall be forfeit where no delivery is made within the time-limit laid down in paragraph 1. #NP# Article 5 #NP# The minimum price paid for wine delivered for distillation under this Regulation shall be EUR 1,914/% vol/hl for table wine and EUR 2,30/% vol/hl for quality wines psr. #NP# Article 6 #NP# 1.

These measures fall within the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, in order to avoid any distortion of competition, Community measures are necessary to implement them as far as the Community is concerned. #NP# (3) For the purpose of this Regulation, the territory of the Community should be deemed to encompass the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty. #NP# (4) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication. #NP# (5) The Treaty, in Articles 60 and 301, empowers the Council to take, under certain conditions, measures aimed at the interruption or reduction of payments or movement of capital and of economic relations with regard to third countries. The measures laid down in this Regulation, targeted also at individual persons not directly linked to the government of a third country, are necessary to attain this objective of the Community and Article 308 of the Treaty empowers the Council to take such measures if no other specific powers are provided for in the Treaty, #NP# HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: #NP# Article 1 #NP# For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply: #NP# 1.

64,32005A0603_03,en,2005,"Council Opinion #NP# of 17 February 2005 #NP# on the updated convergence programme of Estonia, 2004-2008 #NP# (2005/C 136/03) #NP# THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, #NP# Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies [1], and in particular Article 9(3) thereof, #NP# Having regard to the recommendation of the Commission, #NP# After consulting the Economic and Financial Committee, #NP# HAS DELIVERED THIS OPINION: #NP# (1) On 17 February 2005 the Council examined the updated convergence programme of Estonia, which covers the period 2004 to 2008. The programme complies with the data requirements of the revised ""code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes"". #NP# (2) The macroeconomic scenario underlying the programme envisages real GDP growth to pick up from 5.6 % in 2004 to 6.0 % on average over the rest of the programme period. On the basis of currently available information, this scenario seems to reflect plausible growth assumptions. The programme's projections for inflation also appear realistic. #NP# (3) Estonia aims at achieving a budgetary position of close-to-balance or small surplus throughout the programme period. For 2004, the programme targets a budget surplus of 1 % of GDP which is 0.3 % higher than the surplus planned in the programme of last May. From 2005 onwards, balanced budgets are envisaged, as was the case in the previous programme. Public investment in 2004 is foreseen to increase by one percentage point of GDP to 4.4 % before declining to 3.9 % by 2008, and remains thus well above the EU average (2.4 % of GDP in 2004). #NP# (4) The risks to the budgetary projections in the programme appear broadly balanced. On the one hand, the cautious macroeconomic scenario suggests that revenues could be higher and expenditure somewhat lower than budgeted. Indeed, Estonia has established a track record of prudent forecasting and repeated overshooting of fiscal targets over the past few years. On the other hand, unexpected revenue shortfalls from the planned tax cuts, or an adverse impact on growth from exogenous shocks cannot be excluded altogether. Considering the balance of risks, the budgetary stance in the programme seems adequate to maintain the Stability and Growth Pact's medium-term objective of a position of close-to-balance over the entire programme period 2004-2008. It also seems to provide a sufficient safety margin against breaching the 3 % of GDP deficit threshold with normal macroeconomic fluctuations. #NP# (5) The debt ratio is estimated at 4.8 % of GDP in 2004, well below the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value and indeed the lowest in the EU. The programme projects the debt ratio to further decline by 1.9 percentage points over the programme period. #NP# (6) Estonia appears to be in a favourable position with regard to the long-term sustainability of the public finances, despite important projected budgetary costs of an ageing population. A low government debt level, considerable government financial reserves and a medium-term budgetary strategy that is fully consistent with the objective of a close-to-balance-or-in-surplus budgetary position, together with credible and thorough reforms of the pension and health care systems which are meant to stem budgetary pressures in the longer term, should ensure that public finances remain on a sustainable footing. #NP# (7) The economic policies outlined in the update are broadly consistent with the country-specific broad economic policy guidelines in the area of public finances. The higher-than-projected budget surplus in 2004 is in line with the recommendation to avoid pro-cyclical fiscal policies. Nevertheless, given that the external account deficit has most likely not narrowed significantly (if at all) in 2004, a rapid run-down of the budget surplus may provide insufficient support from the fiscal policy stance to the correction of the external imbalance. #NP# | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | #NP# Real GDP(% change) | CP Dec 2004 | 5,6 | 5,9 | 6,0 | 6,0 | 6,0 | #NP# COM Oct 2004 | 5,9 | 6,0 | 6,2 | n.a. | n.a. | #NP# CP May 2004 | 5,3 | 5,8 | 5,6 | 5,9 | 5,8 | #NP# HICP inflation(%) | CP Dec 2004 | 3,3 | 3,2 | 2,5 | 2,8 | 2,8 | #NP# COM Oct 2004 | 3,4 | 3,5 | 2,8 | n.a. | n.a. | #NP# CP May 2004 | 3,1 | 3,0 | 2,8 | 2,8 | 2,8 | #NP# General government balance(% of GDP) | CP Dec 2004 | 1,0 | 0,0 | 0,0 | 0,0 | 0,0 | #NP# COM Oct 2004 | 0,5 | 0,2 | 0,1 | n.a. | n.a. | #NP# CP May 2004 | 0,7 | 0,0 | 0,0 | 0,0 | 0,0 | #NP# Primary balance(% of GDP) | CP Dec 2004 | 1,3 | 0,2 | 0,2 | 0,2 | 0,2 | #NP# COM Oct 2004 | 0,8 | 0,4 | 0,3 | n.a. | n.a. | #NP# CP May 2004 | 1,0 | 0,3 | 0,3 | 0,3 | 0,3 | #NP# Government gross debt(% of GDP) | CP Dec 2004 | 4,8 | 4,6 | 4,3 | 3,1 | 2,9 | #NP# COM Oct 2004 | 4,8 | 4,4 | 4,2 | n.a. | n.a. | #NP# CP May 2004 | 5,4 | 5,1 | 4,7 | 3,4 | 3,2 | #NP# [1] OJ L 209, 2.8.1997, p. 1. #NP# -------------------------------------------------- #S#  #S# ",6340;3482;5619;202,24;08;72;16,2436;0806;7206;7231;7236;1606,2448;3467;122;2106;2200;5283;5781;c_b2c019c8;911;2497,2448;6340;3467;3482;122;5619;2106;2200;5283;5774;5781;c_b2c019c8;911;2497;202,train

Commission Decision 2002/268/EC [2] confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive. #NP# (2) In October 1997 the Netherlands received an application from DuPont de Nemours concerning indoxacarb (former name: DPX-KN128). Commission Decision 98/398/EC [3] confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive. #NP# (3) In July 1999 the Netherlands received an application from Dow Agrosciences concerning spinosad. Commission Decision 2000/210/EC [4] confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive. #NP# (4) In July 1996 the Netherlands received an application from Biosys concerning Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Commission Decision 97/865/EC [5] confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive. #NP# (5) Confirmation of the completeness of the dossiers was necessary in order to allow them to be examined in detail and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations, for periods up to three years, for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and, in particular, the condition relating to the detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant protection product in the light of the requirements laid down by that Directive. #NP# (6) For these active substances, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the respective applicants. The rapporteur Member States submitted the draft assessment reports to the Commission on 22 November 2002 (boscalid), 7 February 2000 (indoxacarb), 5 March 2001 (spinosad) and 19 November 1999 (Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus). #NP# (7) Following submission of the draft assessment reports by the rapporteur Member States, it has been necessary to request further information from the applicants and to have the Rapporteur Member States examine that information and submit their assessments. Therefore, the examination of the dossiers is still ongoing and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the timeframe provided for in Directive 91/414/EEC. #NP# (8) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossiers to continue. It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on possible Annex I inclusion for each of the active substances concerned will have been completed within 24 months. #NP# (9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, #NP# HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: #NP# Article 1 #NP# Member States may extend provisional authorisations for plant protection products containing boscalid, indoxacarb, spinosad or Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus for a period not exceeding 24 months from the date of adoption of this Decision. #NP# Article 2 #NP# This Decision is addressed to the Member States. #S# Done at Brussels, 19 October 2005. #NP# For the Commission #NP# Markos Kyprianou #NP# Member of the Commission #NP# [1] OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.

67,32005L0056,en,2005,"Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council #NP# of 26 October 2005 #NP# on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies #NP# (Text with EEA relevance) #NP# THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 44 thereof, #NP# Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, #NP# Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], #NP# Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], #NP# Whereas: #NP# (1) There is a need for cooperation and consolidation between limited liability companies from different Member States. However, as regards cross-border mergers of limited liability companies, they encounter many legislative and administrative difficulties in the Community. It is therefore necessary, with a view to the completion and functioning of the single market, to lay down Community provisions to facilitate the carrying-out of cross-border mergers between various types of limited liability company governed by the laws of different Member States. #NP# (2) This Directive facilitates the cross-border merger of limited liability companies as defined herein. The laws of the Member States are to allow the cross-border merger of a national limited liability company with a limited liability company from another Member State if the national law of the relevant Member States permits mergers between such types of company. #NP# (3) In order to facilitate cross-border merger operations, it should be laid down that, unless this Directive provides otherwise, each company taking part in a cross-border merger, and each third party concerned, remains subject to the provisions and formalities of the national law which would be applicable in the case of a national merger. None of the provisions and formalities of national law, to which reference is made in this Directive, should introduce restrictions on freedom of establishment or on the free movement of capital save where these can be justified in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice and in particular by requirements of the general interest and are both necessary for, and proportionate to, the attainment of such overriding requirements. #NP# (4) The common draft terms of the cross-border merger are to be drawn up in the same terms for each of the companies concerned in the various Member States. The minimum content of such common draft terms should therefore be specified, while leaving the companies free to agree on other items. #NP# (5) In order to protect the interests of members and others, both the common draft terms of cross-border mergers and the completion of the cross-border merger are to be publicised for each merging company via an entry in the appropriate public register. #NP# (6) The laws of all the Member States should provide for the drawing-up at national level of a report on the common draft terms of the cross-border merger by one or more experts on behalf of each of the companies that are merging. In order to limit experts‚Äô costs connected with cross-border mergers, provision should be made for the possibility of drawing up a single report intended for all members of companies taking part in a cross-border merger operation. The common draft terms of the cross-border merger are to be approved by the general meeting of each of those companies. #NP# (7) In order to facilitate cross-border merger operations, it should be provided that monitoring of the completion and legality of the decision-making process in each merging company should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over each of those companies, whereas monitoring of the completion and legality of the cross-border merger should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over the company resulting from the cross-border merger. The national authority in question may be a court, a notary or any other competent authority appointed by the Member State concerned. The national law determining the date on which the cross-border merger takes effect, this being the law to which the company resulting from the cross-border merger is subject, should also be specified. #NP# (8) In order to protect the interests of members and others, the legal effects of the cross-border merger, distinguishing as to whether the company resulting from the cross-border merger is an acquiring company or a new company, should be specified. In the interests of legal certainty, it should no longer be possible, after the date on which a cross-border merger takes effect, to declare the merger null and void. #NP# (9) This Directive is without prejudice to the application of the legislation on the control of concentrations between undertakings, both at Community level, by Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 [3], and at the level of Member States. #NP# (10) This Directive does not affect Community legislation regulating credit intermediaries and other financial undertakings and national rules made or introduced pursuant to such Community legislation. #NP# (11) This Directive is without prejudice to a Member State‚Äôs legislation demanding information on the place of central administration or the principal place of business proposed for the company resulting from the cross-border merger. #NP# (12) Employees‚Äô rights other than rights of participation should remain subject to the national provisions referred to in Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on collective redundancies [4], Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 on the safeguarding of employees‚Äô rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses [5], Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2002 establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community [6] and Council Directive 94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees [7]. #NP# (13) If employees have participation rights in one of the merging companies under the circumstances set out in this Directive and, if the national law of the Member State in which the company resulting from the cross-border merger has its registered office does not provide for the same level of participation as operated in the relevant merging companies, including in committees of the supervisory board that have decision-making powers, or does not provide for the same entitlement to exercise rights for employees of establishments resulting from the cross-border merger, the participation of employees in the company resulting from the cross-border merger and their involvement in the definition of such rights are to be regulated. To that end, the principles and procedures provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European company (SE) [8] and in Council Directive 2001/86/EC of 8 October 2001 supplementing the Statute for a European company with regard to the involvement of employees [9], are to be taken as a basis, subject, however, to modifications that are deemed necessary because the resulting company will be subject to the national laws of the Member State where it has its registered office. A prompt start to negotiations under Article 16 of this Directive, with a view to not unnecessarily delaying mergers, may be ensured by Member States in accordance with Article 3(2)(b) of Directive 2001/86/EC. #NP# (14) For the purpose of determining the level of employee participation operated in the relevant merging companies, account should also be taken of the proportion of employee representatives amongst the members of the management group, which covers the profit units of the companies, subject to employee participation. #NP# (15) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely laying down rules with common features applicable at transnational level, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and impact of the proposed action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective. #NP# (16) In accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making [10], Member States should be encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures and to make them public, #NP# HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: #NP# Article 1 #NP# Scope #NP# This Directive shall apply to mergers of limited liability companies formed in accordance with the law of a Member State and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the Community, provided at least two of them are governed by the laws of different Member States (hereinafter referred to as cross-border mergers). #NP# Article 2 #NP# Definitions #NP# For the purposes of this Directive: #NP# 1) ""limited liability company"", hereinafter referred to as ""company"", means: #NP# (a) a company as referred to in Article 1 of Directive 68/151/EEC [11], or #NP# (b) a company with share capital and having legal personality, possessing separate assets which alone serve to cover its debts and subject under the national law governing it to conditions concerning guarantees such as are provided for by Directive 68/151/EEC for the protection of the interests of members and others; #NP# 2. ""merger"" means an operation whereby: #NP# (a) one or more companies, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfer all their assets and liabilities to another existing company, the acquiring company, in exchange for the issue to their members of securities or shares representing the capital of that other company and, if applicable, a cash payment not exceeding 10 % of the nominal value, or, in the absence of a nominal value, of the accounting par value of those securities or shares; or #NP# (b) two or more companies, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfer all their assets and liabilities to a company that they form, the new company, in exchange for the issue to their members of securities or shares representing the capital of that new company and, if applicable, a cash payment not exceeding 10 % of the nominal value, or in the absence of a nominal value, of the accounting par value of those securities or shares; or #NP# (c) a company, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfers all its assets and liabilities to the company holding all the securities or shares representing its capital. #NP# Article 3 #NP# Further provisions concerning the scope #NP# 1. Notwithstanding Article 2(2), this Directive shall also apply to cross-border mergers where the law of at least one of the Member States concerned allows the cash payment referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 2(2) to exceed 10 % of the nominal value, or, in the absence of a nominal value, of the accounting par value of the securities or shares representing the capital of the company resulting from the cross-border merger. #NP# 2. Member States may decide not to apply this Directive to cross-border mergers involving a cooperative society even in the cases where the latter would fall within the definition of ""limited liability company"" as laid down in Article 2(1). #NP# 3. This Directive shall not apply to cross-border mergers involving a company the object of which is the collective investment of capital provided by the public, which operates on the principle of risk-spreading and the units of which are, at the holders‚Äô request, repurchased or redeemed, directly or indirectly, out of the assets of that company. Action taken by such a company to ensure that the stock exchange value of its units does not vary significantly from its net asset value shall be regarded as equivalent to such repurchase or redemption. #NP# Article 4 #NP# Conditions relating to cross-border mergers #NP# 1. Save as otherwise provided in this Directive, #NP# (a) cross-border mergers shall only be possible between types of companies which may merge under the national law of the relevant Member States, and #NP# (b) a company taking part in a cross-border merger shall comply with the provisions and formalities of the national law to which it is subject. The laws of a Member State enabling its national authorities to oppose a given internal merger on grounds of public interest shall also be applicable to a cross-border merger where at least one of the merging companies is subject to the law of that Member State. This provision shall not apply to the extent that Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 is applicable. #NP# 2. The provisions and formalities referred to in paragraph 1(b) shall, in particular, include those concerning the decision-making process relating to the merger and, taking into account the cross-border nature of the merger, the protection of creditors of the merging companies, debenture holders and the holders of securities or shares, as well as of employees as regards rights other than those governed by Article 16. A Member State may, in the case of companies participating in a cross-border merger and governed by its law, adopt provisions designed to ensure appropriate protection for minority members who have opposed the cross-border merger. #NP# Article 5 #NP# Common draft terms of cross-border mergers #NP# The management or administrative organ of each of the merging companies shall draw up the common draft terms of cross-border merger. The common draft terms of cross-border merger shall include at least the following particulars: #NP# (a) the form, name and registered office of the merging companies and those proposed for the company resulting from the cross-border merger; #NP# (b) the ratio applicable to the exchange of securities or shares representing the company capital and the amount of any cash payment; #NP# (c) the terms for the allotment of securities or shares representing the capital of the company resulting from the cross-border merger; #NP# (d) the likely repercussions of the cross-border merger on employment; #NP# (e) the date from which the holding of such securities or shares representing the company capital will entitle the holders to share in profits and any special conditions affecting that entitlement; #NP# (f) the date from which the transactions of the merging companies will be treated for accounting purposes as being those of the company resulting from the cross-border merger; #NP# (g) the rights conferred by the company resulting from the cross-border merger on members enjoying special rights or on holders of securities other than shares representing the company capital, or the measures proposed concerning them; #NP# (h) any special advantages granted to the experts who examine the draft terms of the cross-border merger or to members of the administrative, management, supervisory or controlling organs of the merging companies; #NP# (i) the statutes of the company resulting from the cross-border merger; #NP# (j) where appropriate, information on the procedures by which arrangements for the involvement of employees in the definition of their rights to participation in the company resulting from the cross-border merger are determined pursuant to Article 16; #NP# (k) information on the evaluation of the assets and liabilities which are transferred to the company resulting from the cross-border merger; #NP# (l) dates of the merging companies‚Äô accounts used to establish the conditions of the cross-border merger. #NP# Article 6 #NP# Publication #NP# 1. The common draft terms of the cross-border merger shall be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC for each of the merging companies at least one month before the date of the general meeting which is to decide thereon. #NP# 2. For each of the merging companies and subject to the additional requirements imposed by the Member State to which the company concerned is subject, the following particulars shall be published in the national gazette of that Member State: #NP# (a) the type, name and registered office of every merging company; #NP# (b) the register in which the documents referred to in Article 3(2) of Directive 68/151/EEC are filed in respect of each merging company, and the number of the entry in that register; #NP# (c) an indication, for each of the merging companies, of the arrangements made for the exercise of the rights of creditors and of any minority members of the merging companies and the address at which complete information on those arrangements may be obtained free of charge. #NP# Article 7 #NP# Report of the management or administrative organ #NP# The management or administrative organ of each of the merging companies shall draw up a report intended for the members explaining and justifying the legal and economic aspects of the cross-border merger and explaining the implications of the cross-border merger for members, creditors and employees. #NP# The report shall be made available to the members and to the representatives of the employees or, where there are no such representatives, to the employees themselves, not less than one month before the date of the general meeting referred to in Article 9. #NP# Where the management or administrative organ of any of the merging companies receives, in good time, an opinion from the representatives of their employees, as provided for under national law, that opinion shall be appended to the report. #NP# Article 8 #NP# Independent expert report #NP# 1. An independent expert report intended for members and made available not less than one month before the date of the general meeting referred to in Article 9 shall be drawn up for each merging company. Depending on the law of each Member State, such experts may be natural persons or legal persons. #NP# 2. As an alternative to experts operating on behalf of each of the merging companies, one or more independent experts, appointed for that purpose at the joint request of the companies by a judicial or administrative authority in the Member State of one of the merging companies or of the company resulting from the cross-border merger or approved by such an authority, may examine the common draft terms of cross-border merger and draw up a single written report to all the members. #NP# 3. The expert report shall include at least the particulars provided for by Article 10(2) of Council Directive 78/855/EEC of 9 October 1978 concerning mergers of public limited liability companies [12]. The experts shall be entitled to secure from each of the merging companies all information they consider necessary for the discharge of their duties. #NP# 4. Neither an examination of the common draft terms of cross-border merger by independent experts nor an expert report shall be required if all the members of each of the companies involved in the cross-border merger have so agreed. #NP# Article 9 #NP# Approval by the general meeting #NP# 1. After taking note of the reports referred to in Articles 7 and 8, the general meeting of each of the merging companies shall decide on the approval of the common draft terms of cross-border merger. #NP# 2. The general meeting of each of the merging companies may reserve the right to make implementation of the cross-border merger conditional on express ratification by it of the arrangements decided on with respect to the participation of employees in the company resulting from the cross-border merger. #NP# 3. The laws of a Member State need not require approval of the merger by the general meeting of the acquiring company if the conditions laid down in Article 8 of Directive 78/855/EEC are fulfilled. #NP# Article 10 #NP# Pre-merger certificate #NP# 1. Each Member State shall designate the court, notary or other authority competent to scrutinise the legality of the cross-border merger as regards that part of the procedure which concerns each merging company subject to its national law. #NP# 2. In each Member State concerned the authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall issue, without delay to each merging company subject to that State‚Äôs national law, a certificate conclusively attesting to the proper completion of the pre-merger acts and formalities. #NP# 3. If the law of a Member State to which a merging company is subject provides for a procedure to scrutinise and amend the ratio applicable to the exchange of securities or shares, or a procedure to compensate minority members, without preventing the registration of the cross-border merger, such procedure shall only apply if the other merging companies situated in Member States which do not provide for such procedure explicitly accept, when approving the draft terms of the cross-border merger in accordance with Article 9(1), the possibility for the members of that merging company to have recourse to such procedure, to be initiated before the court having jurisdiction over that merging company. In such cases, the authority referred to in paragraph 1 may issue the certificate referred to in paragraph 2 even if such procedure has commenced. The certificate must, however, indicate that the procedure is pending. The decision in the procedure shall be binding on the company resulting from the cross-border merger and all its members. #NP# Article 11 #NP# Scrutiny of the legality of the cross-border merger #NP# 1. Each Member State shall designate the court, notary or other authority competent to scrutinise the legality of the cross-border merger as regards that part of the procedure which concerns the completion of the cross-border merger and, where appropriate, the formation of a new company resulting from the cross-border merger where the company created by the cross-border merger is subject to its national law. The said authority shall in particular ensure that the merging companies have approved the common draft terms of cross-border merger in the same terms and, where appropriate, that arrangements for employee participation have been determined in accordance with Article 16. #NP# 2. To that end each merging company shall submit to the authority referred to in paragraph 1 the certificate referred to in Article 10(2) within six months of its issue together with the common draft terms of cross-border merger approved by the general meeting referred to in Article 9. #NP# Article 12 #NP# Entry into effect of the cross-border merger #NP# The law of the Member State to whose jurisdiction the company resulting from the cross-border merger is subject shall determine the date on which the cross-border merger takes effect. That date must be after the scrutiny referred to in Article 11 has been carried out. #NP# Article 13 #NP# Registration #NP# The law of each of the Member States to whose jurisdiction the merging companies were subject shall determine, with respect to the territory of that State, the arrangements, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC, for publicising completion of the cross-border merger in the public register in which each of the companies is required to file documents. #NP# The registry for the registration of the company resulting from the cross-border merger shall notify, without delay, the registry in which each of the companies was required to file documents that the cross-border merger has taken effect. Deletion of the old registration, if applicable, shall be effected on receipt of that notification, but not before. #NP# Article 14 #NP# Consequences of the cross-border merger #NP# 1. A cross-border merger carried out as laid down in points (a) and (c) of Article 2(2) shall, from the date referred to in Article 12, have the following consequences: #NP# (a) all the assets and liabilities of the company being acquired shall be transferred to the acquiring company; #NP# (b) the members of the company being acquired shall become members of the acquiring company; #NP# (c) the company being acquired shall cease to exist. #NP# 2.

Where, in the case of a cross-border merger of companies covered by this Directive, the laws of the Member States require the completion of special formalities before the transfer of certain assets, rights and obligations by the merging companies becomes effective against third parties, those formalities shall be carried out by the company resulting from the cross-border merger. #NP# 4. The rights and obligations of the merging companies arising from contracts of employment or from employment relationships and existing at the date on which the cross-border merger takes effect shall, by reason of that cross-border merger taking effect, be transferred to the company resulting from the cross-border merger on the date on which the cross-border merger takes effect. #NP# 5. No shares in the acquiring company shall be exchanged for shares in the company being acquired held either: #NP# (a) by the acquiring company itself or through a person acting in his or her own name but on its behalf; #NP# (b) by the company being acquired itself or through a person acting in his or her own name but on its behalf. #NP# Article 15 #NP# Simplified formalities #NP# 1. Where a cross-border merger by acquisition is carried out by a company which holds all the shares and other securities conferring the right to vote at general meetings of the company or companies being acquired: #NP# - Articles 5, points (b), (c) and (e), 8 and 14(1), point (b) shall not apply, #NP# - Article 9(1) shall not apply to the company or companies being acquired. #NP# 2. Where a cross-border merger by acquisition is carried out by a company which holds 90 % or more but not all of the shares and other securities conferring the right to vote at general meetings of the company or companies being acquired, reports by an independent expert or experts and the documents necessary for scrutiny shall be required only to the extent that the national law governing either the acquiring company or the company being acquired so requires. #NP# Article 16 #NP# Employee participation #NP# 1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the company resulting from the cross-border merger shall be subject to the rules in force concerning employee participation, if any, in the Member State where it has its registered office. #NP# 2. However, the rules in force concerning employee participation, if any, in the Member State where the company resulting from the cross-border merger has its registered office shall not apply, where at least one of the merging companies has, in the six months before the publication of the draft terms of the cross-border merger as referred to in Article 6, an average number of employees that exceeds 500 and is operating under an employee participation system within the meaning of Article 2(k) of Directive 2001/86/EC, or where the national law applicable to the company resulting from the cross-border merger does not #NP# (a) provide for at least the same level of employee participation as operated in the relevant merging companies, measured by reference to the proportion of employee representatives amongst the members of the administrative or supervisory organ or their committees or of the management group which covers the profit units of the company, subject to employee representation, or #NP# (b) provide for employees of establishments of the company resulting from the cross-border merger that are situated in other Member States the same entitlement to exercise participation rights as is enjoyed by those employees employed in the Member State where the company resulting from the cross-border merger has its registered office. #NP# 3. In the cases referred to in paragraph 2, the participation of employees in the company resulting from the cross-border merger and their involvement in the definition of such rights shall be regulated by the Member States, mutatis mutandis and subject to paragraphs 4 to 7 below, in accordance with the principles and procedures laid down in Article 12(2), (3) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 and the following provisions of Directive 2001/86/EC: #NP# (a) Article 3(1), (2) and (3), (4) first subparagraph, first indent, and second subparagraph, (5) and (7); #NP# (b) Article 4(1), (2), points (a), (g) and (h), and (3); #NP# (c) Article 5; #NP# (d) Article 6; #NP# (e) Article 7(1), (2) first subparagraph, point (b), and second subparagraph, and (3). However, for the purposes of this Directive, the percentages required by Article 7(2), first subparagraph, point (b) of Directive 2001/86/EC for the application of the standard rules contained in part 3 of the Annex to that Directive shall be raised from 25 to 33 1/3 %; #NP# (f) Articles 8, 10 and 12; #NP# (g) Article 13(4); #NP# (h) part 3 of the Annex, point (b). #NP# 4. When regulating the principles and procedures referred to in paragraph 3, Member States: #NP# (a) shall confer on the relevant organs of the merging companies the right to choose without any prior negotiation to be directly subject to the standard rules for participation referred to in paragraph 3(h), as laid down by the legislation of the Member State in which the company resulting from the cross-border merger is to have its registered office, and to abide by those rules from the date of registration; #NP# (b) shall confer on the special negotiating body the right to decide, by a majority of two thirds of its members representing at least two thirds of the employees, including the votes of members representing employees in at least two different Member States, not to open negotiations or to terminate negotiations already opened and to rely on the rules on participation in force in the Member State where the registered office of the company resulting from the cross-border merger will be situated; #NP# (c) may, in the case where, following prior negotiations, standard rules for participation apply and notwithstanding these rules, determine to limit the proportion of employee representatives in the administrative organ of the company resulting from the cross-border merger. However, if in one of the merging companies employee representatives constituted at least one third of the administrative or supervisory board, the limitation may never result in a lower proportion of employee representatives in the administrative organ than one third. #NP# 5. The extension of participation rights to employees of the company resulting from the cross-border merger employed in other Member States, referred to in paragraph 2(b), shall not entail any obligation for Member States which choose to do so to take those employees into account when calculating the size of workforce thresholds giving rise to participation rights under national law. #NP# 6. When at least one of the merging companies is operating under an employee participation system and the company resulting from the cross-border merger is to be governed by such a system in accordance with the rules referred to in paragraph 2, that company shall be obliged to take a legal form allowing for the exercise of participation rights. #NP# 7. When the company resulting from the cross-border merger is operating under an employee participation system, that company shall be obliged to take measures to ensure that employees‚Äô participation rights are protected in the event of subsequent domestic mergers for a period of three years after the cross-border merger has taken effect, by applying mutatis mutandis the rules laid down in this Article. #NP# Article 17 #NP# Validity #NP# A cross-border merger which has taken effect as provided for in Article 12 may not be declared null and void. #NP# Article 18 #NP# Review #NP# Five years after the date laid down in the first paragraph of Article 19, the Commission shall review this Directive in the light of the experience acquired in applying it and, if necessary, propose its amendment. #NP# Article 19 #NP# Transposition #NP# Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 15 December 2007. #NP# When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States. #NP# Article 20 #NP# Entry into force #NP# This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# Article 21 #NP# Addressees #NP# This Directive is addressed to the Member States. #S# Done at Strasbourg, 26 October 2005. #NP# For the European Parliament #NP# The President #NP# J.

69,32005R0856,en,2005,"Commission Regulation (EC) No 856/2005 #NP# of 6 June 2005 #NP# amending Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 as regards Fusarium toxins #NP# (Text with EEA relevance) #NP# THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, #NP# Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food [1], and in particular Article 2(3) thereof, #NP# Whereas: #NP# (1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 [2] provides for maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs. #NP# (2) Certain Member States have adopted or plan to adopt maximum levels for Fusarium toxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisins in certain foodstuffs. In view of the disparities between the level authorised in Member States and the consequent risk of distortion of competition, Community measures are necessary in order to ensure market unity while complying with the principle of proportionality. #NP# (3) A variety of Fusarium fungi, which are common soil fungi, produce a number of different mycotoxins of the class of trichothecenes such as deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin and some other toxins (zearalenone and fumonisins). The Fusarium fungi are commonly found on cereals grown in the temperate regions of America, Europe and Asia. Several of the toxin producing Fusarium fungi are capable of producing to a variable degree two or more of these toxins. #NP# (4) The Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) has evaluated in a set of opinions the Fusarium toxins: deoxynivalenol (DON) in December 1999, zearalenone in June 2000, fumonisins in October 2000, updated in April 2003, nivalenol in October 2000 and T-2 and HT-2 toxin in May 2001 and a group evaluation of the trichothecenes in February 2002. #NP# (5) The SCF considered that the available data did not support the establishing of group Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for the evaluated trichothecenes and established #NP# - a TDI of 1 Œºg/kg body weight/day for deoxynivalenol (DON), #NP# - a temporary TDI (t-TDI) of 0,7 Œºg/kg body weight/day for nivalenol, #NP# - a combined temporary TDI of 0,06 Œºg/kg body weight/day for T-2 and HT-2 toxin. #NP# For the other Fusarium toxins the SCF established #NP# - a temporary TDI (t-TDI) of 0,2 Œºg/kg body weight/day for zearalenone, #NP# - a TDI of 2 Œºg/kg bodyweight/day for the total of fumonisin B1, B2 and B3, alone or in combination. #NP# (6) In the framework of Council Directive 93/5/EEC of 25 February 1993 on assistance to the Commission and cooperation by the Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food [3], a scientific cooperation (SCOOP) task 3.2.10 ""Collection of occurrence data on Fusarium toxins in food and assessment of dietary intake by the population of EU Member States"" [4] was performed and finalised in September 2003. #NP# The results of that task demonstrate that Fusarium mycotoxins are widely distributed in the food chain in the Community. The major sources of dietary intake of Fusarium toxins are products made from cereals, in particular wheat and corn. While the dietary intakes of Fusarium toxins for the entire population and adults are often less than the TDI‚Äôs for the respective toxin, for risk groups like infants and young children, they are close or even exceed the TDI in some cases. #NP# (7) In particular for deoxynivalenol, the dietary intake for the group of young children and adolescents is close to the TDI. For T-2 and HT-2 toxin, the estimated dietary intake exceeded in most of the cases the t-TDI. However, it has to be noted that for T-2 and HT-2 toxin most occurrence data were obtained by making use of methods of analysis with a high limit of detection and taking into consideration that the amount of samples above the limit of detection was lower than 20 %, the dietary intake was strongly influenced by the limit of detection of the used analytical methods. For nivalenol all intakes were far below the t-TDI. As regards the other trichothecenes considered in the abovementioned SCOOP-Task, such as 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, fusarenon-X, T2-triol, diacetoxyscirpenol, neosolaniol, monoacetoxyscirpenol and verrucol, as far as the information is available all dietary intakes are low. #NP# (8) For zearalenone, the average daily intake is significantly lower than the TDI but attention should be paid to population groups not identified in the task which might have regularly high consumption of products with high incidence of zearalenone contamination and to food aimed for consumption among children, since the diversity of the diet is among young children is limited. #NP# (9) For fumonisins, the estimated dietary intake for most population groups is far below the TDI. The dietary intake of fumonisins increases significantly when consumers only are considered. Nevertheless, the dietary intake is also for that group of consumers below the TDI. However, monitoring control results of the harvest 2003 indicate that maize and maize products can be very highly contaminated by fumonisins. It is appropriate that measures are taken to avoid that such unacceptably highly contaminated maize and maize products can enter the food chain. #NP# (10) Fusarium species infect the grain pre-harvest. In connection with Fusarium infection and Mycotoxin formation several risk factors have been identified. Climatic conditions during the growth, in particular at flowering, have a major influence on the mycotoxin content. However, good agricultural practices, whereby the risk factors are reduced to a minimum, can prevent to a certain degree the contamination by Fusarium fungi. #NP# (11) It is important for the protection of public health that maximum levels are set on unprocessed cereals in order to avoid that highly contaminated cereals can enter the food chain and to encourage and ensure that all measures are taken during the field, harvest and storage stage of the production chain (by applying good agricultural, harvest and storage practices). It is appropriate to apply the maximum level on unprocessed cereals to cereals placed on the market for first stage processing as the intended use (for food, feed or industrial) of the cereals is known at this stage. Cleaning, sorting, drying procedures are not considered as first-stage processing insofar no physical action is exerted on the grain kernel itself while scouring is to be considered as first-stage processing. #NP# (12) Maximum levels are set at a level taking into account the current human exposure in relation with the tolerable intake of the toxin in question and which can be reasonably achieved by following good practices at all stages of production and distribution. Such an approach ensures that food business operators apply all possible measures to prevent/reduce the contamination as far as possible in order to protect public health. #NP# (13) For maize, not all factors involved in the formation of Fusarium toxins, in particular zearalenone and fumonisins B1 and B2 are yet precisely known. Therefore, a time period is granted to enable food business operators in the cereal chain to perform investigations on the sources of the formation of these mycotoxins and on the identification of the management measures to be taken to prevent their presence as much as reasonably possible. Maximum levels based currently available occurrence data are proposed to apply from 2007 in case no specific maximum levels based on new information on occurrence and formation are set before that time. #NP# (14) Through cleaning and processing the content of Fusarium toxins in raw cereals can be reduced at a varying degree in processed cereal products. Given the varying degree of reduction, it is appropriate to set a maximum level for final consumer cereal products to protect the consumer and necessary to have an enforceable legislation. In setting maximum levels for final consumer cereal products, a pragmatic approach has to be followed. Furthermore the setting of a maximum level for major food ingredients derived from cereals is appropriate in order to ensure an efficient enforcement in the interest of ensuring public health protection. #NP# (15) Given the low contamination levels of Fusarium toxins found in rice, no maximum levels are proposed for rice or rice products. #NP# (16) It is not necessary due to co-occurrence to consider specific measures for 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol and Fumonisin B3, as possible measures with regard to in particular deoxynivalenol and Fumonisin B1 + B2 would also protect the human population from an unacceptable exposure from 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol and Fumonisin B3. The same applies to nivalenol for which to a certain degree co-occurrence with deoxynivalenol can be observed and human exposure to nivalenol is estimated to be significantly below the t-TDI. #NP# (17) Data on the presence of T-2 and HT-2 toxin are for the time being limited. There is also an urgent need for the development and validation of a sensitive method of analysis. However intake estimates indicate clearly that the presence of T-2 and HT-2 can be of concern for public health. Therefore, the development of a sensitive method, collection of more occurrence data and more investigations/research in the factors involved in the presence of T-2 and HT-2 in cereal and cereal products, in particular in oats and oat products, is necessary and of high priority. #NP# (18) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly. #NP# (19) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, #NP# HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: #NP# Article 1 #NP# Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 is amended as follows: #NP# (1) In Article 2, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following: #NP# ""3. Without prejudice to Articles 3(1) and 4(3), the following shall be prohibited #NP# (a) to use products, which do not comply with the maximum levels set out in Annex I, as food ingredients for the production of compound or other foodstuffs; #NP# (b) to mix products complying with the maximum levels with products exceeding the maximum levels set out in Annex I; #NP# (c) to deliberately detoxify products by chemical treatments in the case of contaminants listed in section 2 (Mycotoxins) of Annex I."" #NP# (2) In Article 5, the following paragraph 5 is added: #NP# ""5. The Commission shall review points 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 of section 2 of Annex I by 1 July 2008 as regards the maximum limits for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and fumonisin B1+B2 and with a view to including a maximum level for T-2 and HT-2 toxin in cereals and cereal products. #NP# For that purpose, the Member States and interested parties shall communicate each year to the Commission the results of investigations undertaken including occurrence data and the progress with regard to the application of prevention measures to avoid contamination by deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, T-2 and HT-2 toxin and fumonisin B1+B2."" #NP# (3) Annex I is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation. #NP# Article 2 #NP# This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# It shall apply from 1 July 2006.

(Casale Monferrato, Italy), ITALCEMENTI GROUP (Bergamo, Italy) (represented by: Massimo Merla, Claudio Tesauro, lawyers) #NP# Defendant(s): Commission of the European Communities #NP# Form of order sought #NP# The applicants claim that the Court should: #NP# - insofar as the Commission is unable to demonstrate that the mandate given to Commissioner Dimas authorised him to be a signatory to measures adopted concerning competition policy and, in particular, state aid, make a declaration that the Decision is null and of no effect; #NP# - annul: (i) that part of the Decision in which, by stating that no objections are made to the national allocation plan (%quot%NAP%quot%) (Article 2 of the Decision) and thereby approving the distribution of allowances among the sectors of industry set out in the plan, it sanctioned the discrimination inherent in that distribution which favoured undertakings in some sectors to the disadvantage of other undertakings; (ii) that part of the Decision which states that the intended authorisation of existing installations which are subject to an update of their permits to draw allowances from the new entrants reserve for the part of the modified installation which already existed before the permit update, even where the new entrants have not used up the allowances specifically reserved for them, is incompatible with criterion (10) of Annex III to Directive 2003/87/EC; and (iii) that part of the Decision which calls upon the Italian state to amend the NAP so that existing installations which are subject to an update of their permits are not allowed to draw allowances from the new entrants reserve for the part of the modified installation which already existed before the permit update (Article 2(b) of the Decision). #NP# - order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings. #NP# Pleas in law and main arguments #NP# The subject of this action is the Decision of 25 May 2005 [1] in which the Commission gave its opinion on the compatibility of the national allocation plan for greenhouse gas emission allowances notified to it by Italy (%quot%NAP%quot%) with the criteria listed in Annex III to Directive 2003/87 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2002 [2]. #NP# First, the applicants seek to ascertain whether the Commissioner who was signatory to the contested measure is competent to adopt the Decision. In particular, they call upon the Court of First Instance to establish whether Commissioner Dimas has competence in relation to measures adopted concerning competition policy and, in particular, state aid, and to make a declaration, should there be sufficient grounds, that the contested measure is null and of no effect. #NP# Secondly, the applicants contend that by examining the NAP, a measure that is liable to incorporate elements of state aid, without complying with the procedural provisions in Article 88 (2) and (3) EC, the Commission infringed that provision. #NP# Thirdly, the applicants submit that when the Commission became aware that there were potential state aid aspects to the NAP, it infringed Article 87 EC, criterion (5) of Annex III to Directive 2003/87 EC and the principle of non-discrimination in that, by approving the distribution of allowances set out in the NAP, it gave its approval to the discrimination inherent in that distribution, which was to the detriment of cement producers. #NP# The applicants submit fourthly that the Commission misapplied criterion (10) of Annex III to Directive 2003/87 EC in stating that %quot%Italy's intended authorisation of existing installations which are subject to an update of their permits to draw allowances from the new entrants reserve for the part of the modified installation which already existed before the permit update%quot% was contrary to that criterion. The Commission thereby infringed criterion (5) of Annex III to Directive 2003/87 EC and the principle of non-discrimination in that, by failing to take account of the specific nature of the sectors of industry affected by the implementation of the Directive as far as their capacity to increase production was concerned, it again placed cement producers at a disadvantage compared with other producers. #NP# Lastly, the applicants claim that by approving the NAP notwithstanding the facts that it does not make express provision for undertakings to make appropriate preparations for the transfer of allowances or pooling of installations, that it provides for reference periods for the transfer of residual allowances other than a five-year period and that it imposes unjustifiable restrictions on the pooling of installations and does not make provision for the surrender of cancelled emission allowances, the Commission infringed Articles 11, 12, 13 and 28 of Directive 2003/87 EC. #NP# [1] Commission Decision of 25 May 2005 on the national allocation plan for the allocation of greenhouse gas emission allowances notified by Italy in accordance with Directive 2003/87 of the European Parliament and Council [C(2005)1527 fin, OJ C 226 of 15.09.2005, p. 2]. #NP# [2] Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275 of 25 October 2005, p. 32). #NP# -------------------------------------------------- #S#  #S# ",4044;5837;5993;889;5519;1519;5782;4038,10;12;68;16;72;52,1006;1221;6831;1606;7206;7231;7236;5206,1451;5371;3879;712;5640;122;2106;2200;4590;5283;912;2470,4038;4044;1451;5836;5837;5371;1826;5993;3879;712;889;5640;5519;122;1519;2106;2200;4590;5283;912;5682;5782;2470,train

RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE COMMUNITY‚ÄôS OVERALL AIMS #NP# 2.1. The CAP and Rural Development #NP# Agriculture continues to be the largest user of rural land as well as a key determinant of the quality of the countryside and the environment. The importance and relevance of the CAP and rural development have increased with the recent enlargement of the European Union. #NP# Without the two pillars of the CAP, market policy and rural development, many rural areas of Europe would face increasing economic, social and environmental problems. The European Model of Agriculture reflects the multifunctional role farming plays in the richness and diversity of landscapes, food products and cultural and natural heritage[5]. #NP# The guiding principles for the CAP, market and rural development policies, were set by the European Council in G√∂teborg in 2001 and confirmed in the Lisbon Strategy Conclusions in Thessaloniki in June 2003 ‚Äì Strong economic performance must go hand in hand with the sustainable use of natural resources . #NP# ""Strong economic performance must go hand in hand with the sustainable use of natural resources and levels of waste, maintaining biodiversity, preserving ecosystems and avoiding desertification. To meet these challenges, the European Council agrees that the Common Agricultural Policy and its future development should, among its objectives, contribute to achieving sustainable development by increasing its emphasis on encouraging healthy, high quality products, environmentally sustainable production methods, including organic production, renewable raw materials and the protection of biodiversity."" Presidency Conclusions, European Council, G√∂teborg 2001 | #NP# The reformed CAP and Rural Development can make a key contribution to competitiveness and sustainable development in the coming years. #NP# 2.2. Towards Sustainable Agriculture: the 2003 and 2004 CAP Reforms #NP# The 2003 and 2004 CAP reforms represent a major step forward to improve the competitiveness and sustainable development of farming activity in the EU and set the framework for future reforms. Successive reforms have boosted the competitiveness of European agriculture by reducing price support guarantees. The introduction of decoupled direct payments encourages farmers to respond to market signals generated by consumer demand rather than by quantity related policy incentives. The inclusion of environment, food safety, animal health and welfare standards in cross-compliance reinforces consumer confidence and increases the environmental sustainability of farming. #NP# 2.3. Rural Development 2007‚Äì2013 #NP# The future Rural Development policy focuses on three key areas: the agrifood economy, the environment and the broader rural economy and population. The new generation of rural development strategies and programmes will be built around a competitiveness axis for agriculture, food and forestry, a land management-environment axis and a quality of life/diversification axis in rural areas. #NP# Under the competitiveness axis a range of measures will target human and physical capital in the agriculture, food and forestry sectors (promoting knowledge transfer and innovation) and quality production. The land management-environmental axis provides measures to protect and enhance natural resources, as well as preserving high-nature value farming and forestry systems and cultural landscapes of Europe‚Äôs rural areas. The third axis helps to develop local infrastructure and human capital in rural areas to improve the conditions for growth and job creation in all sectors and the diversification of economic activities. #NP# A fourth axis based on the Leader experience introduces possibilities for innovative governance through locally based bottom-up approaches to rural development. #NP# 2.4. Meeting the challenges #NP# Rural areas are characterised by a very large diversity of situations, ranging from remote rural areas suffering from depopulation and decline to peri-urban areas under increasing pressure from urban centres. #NP# According to the OECD definition, which is based on population density, rural regions[6] represent in the EU-25 92% of the territory. Furthermore, 19% of the population live in predominantly rural regions and 37% live in significantly rural regions. These regions generate 45% of Gross Value Added (GVA) in the EU-25 and provide 53% of the employment, but tend to lag as regards a number of socio-economic indicators, including Structural Indicators[7], compared to non-rural areas. In rural areas, income per inhabitant is around a third less[8], activity rates for women are lower, the service sector is less developed, higher education levels are generally lower, and a lower percentage of households has access to ‚Äòbroadband‚Äô internet. Remoteness and peripherality are major problems in some rural regions. These disadvantages tend to be even more significant in predominantly rural regions, although the general picture at EU level can vary substantially between Member States. Lack of opportunities, contacts and training infrastructure are a particular problem for women and young people in remote rural areas. #NP# In EU-15 agriculture accounts for 2% of GDP, in the new Member States for 3% and more than 10% in Romania and Bulgaria. In the new Member states three times as many people work in agriculture (12%) compared to the old member states (4%). In Bulgaria and Romania agricultural employment levels are considerably higher. #NP# The combined agricultural and food sector represents an important part of the EU economy accounting for 15m jobs (8.3% of total employment) and 4.4% of GDP for in EU-25. The EU is the world's largest producer of food and beverages, with combined production estimated at ‚Ç¨675 billion. However, the sector remains highly polarised and fragmented in terms of size with significant opportunities and threats for firms[9]. Forestry and related industries employ around 3.4m people with a turnover of ‚Ç¨350bn, but only 60% of annual forest growth is currently exploited[10]. #NP# Agriculture and forestry represent 77% of land use in the EU-25. The environmental performance of agriculture in the preservation and enhancement of natural resources in recent years has been mixed. As regards water quality, total nitrogen surplus has not significantly changed since 1990 in the old Member States. Problems of ammonia emissions, eutrophication, soil degradation and decline in biodiversity persist in many areas. However, an increasing part of agricultural area is devoted to organic production (5.4m ha for EU-25) and renewable resources (0,9m ha for EU-15). Long-term trends in climate change will increasingly shape farming and forestry patterns. Protection of biodiversity has made steps forward with the implementation of Natura 2000 ‚Äì around 12-13% of agricultural and forestry area has been designated. High nature value farming systems play an important role in preserving biodiversity and habitats as well as landscape protection and soil quality. In most Member States, these farming systems account for between 10% and 30% of the agricultural area[11]. In some areas the abandonment of farming could entail serious environmental risks[12]. #NP# Rural areas therefore face particular challenges as regards growth, jobs and sustainability in the coming years. But they offer real opportunities in terms of their potential for growth in new sectors, the provision of rural amenities and tourism, their attractiveness as a place to live and work, and their role as a reservoir of natural resources and highly valued landscapes. #NP# The agricultural and food sectors must seize the opportunities offered by new approaches, technologies and innovation to meet evolving market demand both in Europe and globally. Above all, investment in the key resource of human capital will allow rural areas and the agrifood sector to look to the future with confidence. #NP# On the occasion of the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, the European Council has reaffirmed that the Lisbon Strategy is to be seen in the wider context of sustainable development, that present needs must be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs[13]. The new programming period provides a unique opportunity to refocus support from the new rural development fund on growth, jobs and sustainability. In this respect, it is fully in line with the Declaration on the Guiding Principles for Sustainable Development[14] and the renewed Lisbon Action Programme[15] which seeks to target resources at making Europe a more attractive place to invest and work, promoting knowledge and innovation for growth and creating more and better jobs. #NP# Rural development policy must help rural areas meet these objectives in the period 2007‚Äì2013. This requires a more strategic approach to competitiveness, job creation and innovation in rural areas and improved governance in the delivery of programmes. There must be an increased focus on forward-looking investments in people, know-how and capital in the farm and forestry sectors, on new ways of delivering win-win environmental services and on creating more and better jobs through diversification, particularly for women and young people. By helping the EU‚Äôs rural areas to fulfil their potential as attractive places to invest, work and live, rural development policy can play its part in the sustainable development of Europe‚Äôs territory. #NP# 3. SETTING THE COMMUNITY‚ÄôS PRIORITIES FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT 2007‚Äì2013 #NP# Within the framework of the objectives established in the Rural Development regulation, these guidelines identify priorities for the Community, aimed at the integration of major policy priorities as spelled out in the conclusions of the Lisbon and G√∂teborg European Councils. For each set of priorities, key actions are presented. Member States shall prepare their national rural development strategies, constituting the reference framework for the preparation of rural development programmes, on the basis of these strategic guidelines. #NP# 3.1. Improving the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sectors #NP# Guideline Europe‚Äôs agriculture, forestry and its agrifood sector have great potential to further develop high quality and value added products that meet the diverse and growing demand of Europe‚Äôs consumers and world markets. The resources devoted to axis 1 should contribute to a strong and dynamic European agrifood sector by focusing on the priorities of knowledge transfer and innovation in the food chain and priority sectors for investment in physical and human capital. | #NP# In order to meet these priorities, Member States should focus support on key actions such as: #NP# - facilitating innovation and access to R%amp%D. Innovation is increasingly important for Europe‚Äôs farming, agrifood and forestry sectors. While Europe‚Äôs large agrifood companies are often at the cutting edge of new trends, the introduction of new products and processes could significantly contribute to the performance of smaller processors and farm businesses. In particular, new forms of cooperation could facilitate access to R%amp%D, innovation and actions undertaken under the 7th Framework Programme[16]; #NP# - improving integration in the agrifood chain. Europe‚Äôs food industry is one of the world‚Äôs most competitive and innovative, but it is facing increasing global competition. There is considerable scope in the rural economy to create and market new products, to retain more value in rural areas through quality schemes and to raise the profile of European products overseas. The use of advisory services and support to meet Community standards will contribute to this integration process. A market oriented agricultural sector will help further consolidate the position of Europe‚Äôs agrifood sector as a major employer and source of economic growth; #NP# - encouraging the take-up and diffusion of ICT. The agrifood sector as a whole has been identified as lagging in the take-up of ICT technologies. This is particularly the case for smaller businesses. Adoption of e-business applications is still on a low level outside of large multinationals and their larger suppliers[17]. Rural development funds should complement future Commission initiatives such as i2010 in the fields of e-business (particularly in relation to SMEs), e-skills and e-learning[18]; #NP# - fostering dynamic entrepreneurship. The recent reforms have created a market oriented environment for European farming. This brings new opportunities for farm businesses. But the realisation of this economic potential will depend on the development of strategic and organisational skills ; #NP# - development of new outlets for agricultural and forestry products. New outlets can offer higher value added. Support for investment and training in the field of non-food production under rural development can complement measures taken under the first pillar by creating innovative new outlets for production or helping the development of renewable energy materials, biofuels and processing capacity; #NP# - improving the environmental performance of farms and forestry. Long term sustainability will depend on the ability to produce products that consumers wish to buy, while achieving high environmental standards. Investing in increased environmental performance can also lead to efficiency gains in production, creating a win-win situation; #NP# - restructuring of the agriculture sector. Rural development is a key tool for restructuring, particularly in the New Member States. Enlargement has changed the agricultural map. Successful agricultural adjustment can be the key to improving the competitiveness and environmental sustainability of the agricultural sector and boosting jobs and growth in related areas of the economy. All Member States should promote the anticipation of change within the agricultural sector in the context of restructuring, and develop a proactive approach to training and retraining of farmers, particularly as regards transferable skills. #NP# To enhance generational renewal in agriculture combinations of measures available under axis 1 tailored to the needs of young farmers should be considered. #NP# 3.2. Improving the environment and countryside #NP# Guideline To protect and enhance the EU‚Äôs natural resources and landscapes in rural areas, the resources devoted to axis 2 should contribute to three EU level priority areas: biodiversity and preservation of high nature value farming and forestry systems, water, and climate change. The measures available under axis 2 should be used to integrate these environmental objectives and contribute to the implementation of the agricultural and forestry Natura 2000 network, to the G√∂teborg commitment to reverse biodiversity decline by 2010, to the Water Framework Directive objectives and to the Kyoto Protocol targets for climate change mitigation. | #NP# In order to meet these priorities, Member States should focus support on key actions such as: #NP# - promoting environmental services and animal friendly farming practices. European citizens expect farmers to respect mandatory standards. But many also agree that farmers should be remunerated for signing up to commitments which go further, delivering services that the market will not provide alone, particularly when focused on specific resources such as water and soil; #NP# - preserving the farmed landscape. In Europe, much of the valued rural environment is the product of agriculture. Appropriate farming systems help to preserve landscapes and habitats ranging from wetlands to dry meadows and mountain pastures. In many areas, this is an important part of cultural and natural heritage and of the overall attractiveness of rural areas as places to live and work; #NP# - combating climate change. Agriculture and forestry are at the forefront of the development of renewable energy and material sources for bio-energy installations. The development of these energy sources must take into account reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases and preservation of the carbon sink effect of forests and organic matter in soil composition; #NP# - consolidating the contribution of organic farming. Organic farming represents a holistic approach to sustainable agriculture. In this respect, its contribution to environmental and animal welfare objectives could be further reinforced; #NP# - encouraging environmental/economic win-win initiatives. The provision of environmental goods, particularly through agri-environmental measures, can contribute to the identity of rural areas and their food products. They can form a basis for growth and jobs provided through tourism and the provision of rural amenities, particularly when linked to diversification into tourism, crafts, training or the non-food sector; #NP# - promoting territorial balance. Rural development programmes can make a vital contribution to the attractiveness of rural areas. They can also help ensure that in a competitive, knowledge-based economy, a sustainable balance between urban and rural areas is maintained. In combination with other programme axes, land management measures can make a positive contribution to the spatial distribution of economic activity and territorial cohesion. #NP# 3.3. Improving the quality of life in rural areas and encouraging diversification #NP# Guideline The resources devoted to the fields of diversification of the rural economy and quality of life in rural areas under axis 3 should contribute to the overarching priority of the creation of employment opportunities. The range of measures available under axis 3 should in particular be used to promote capacity building, skills acquisition and organisation for local strategy development and also help ensure that rural areas remain attractive for future generations. In promoting training, information and entrepreneurship, the particular needs of women and young people should be considered. | #NP# In order to meet these priorities, Member States should focus support on key actions such as: #NP# - raising economic activity and employment rates in the wider rural economy. Diversification is necessary for growth, employment and sustainable development in rural areas, and thereby contributes to a better territorial balance, both in economic and social terms. Tourism, crafts and the provision of rural amenities are growth sectors in many regions and offer opportunities both for on-farm diversification and the development of micro-businesses in the broader rural economy; #NP# - encouraging the entry of women into the labour market. Local initiatives to develop childcare facilities in rural areas can improve employment opportunities and facilitate access of women to the labour market. This can include the development of child-care infrastructure, potentially in combination with initiatives to encourage the creation of small businesses related to rural activities; #NP# - developing micro-business and crafts can build on traditional skills or bring new competencies, particularly when combined with purchase of equipment, training and coaching, helping to promote entrepreneurship and develop the economic fabric; #NP# - training young people in traditional rural skills can tap into demand for tourism, recreation, environmental services and quality products; #NP# - encouraging the take-up and diffusion of ICT. Take up and diffusion of ICT is essential in rural areas for diversification, as well as for local development, the provision of local services and the promotion of e-inclusion[19]. Economies of scale can be achieved through village ICT initiatives combining IT equipment, networking and eSkills training through community structures. Such initiatives can greatly facilitate IT take-up by local farms and rural businesses and the adoption of eBusiness and eCommerce. Full advantage needs to be taken of the possibilities afforded by the internet and broadband communications, for example supported by regional programmes under the Structural Funds, to overcome the disadvantages of location[20]; #NP# - developing the provision and innovative use of renewable energy sources can contribute to creating new outlets for agricultural and forestry products, the provision of local services and the diversification of the rural economy; #NP# - encouraging the development of Tourism. Tourism is a major growth sector in many rural areas. Increased use of ITC in tourism for bookings, promotion, marketing, service design and recreational activities can help improve visitor number and length of stays, particularly where this provides links to smaller facilities and encourages agri-tourism; #NP# - upgrading of local infrastructure, particularly in the New Member States . Significant investment will be undertaken in major telecommunications, transport, energy and water infrastructure over the coming years. Considerable support will be available from the Structural Funds ranging from trans-European networks to the development of connections to business or science parks. For the multiplier effect to be fully realised in terms of jobs and growth, small-scale local infrastructure supported within rural development programmes can play a vital role in connecting these major investments to local strategies for diversification and development of agricultural and food-sector potential. #NP# 3.4. Building Local Capacity for Employment and Diversification #NP# Guideline The resources devoted to axis 4 (Leader) should contribute to the priorities of axis 1 and 2 and in particular of axis 3, but also play an important role in the priority of improving governance and mobilising the endogenous development potential of rural areas. | #NP# Support under the Leader axis offers the possibility, in the context of a local development strategy building on local needs and strengths, to combine all three objectives ‚Äì competitiveness, environment and quality of life/diversification. Integrated approaches involving farmers, foresters and other rural actors can safeguard and enhance local natural and cultural heritage, raise environmental awareness and invest in and promote specialty products, tourism and renewable resources and energy. #NP# In order to meet these priorities, Member States should focus support on key actions such as: #NP# - building local partnership capacity, animation and promoting skills acquisition can help mobilise local potential; #NP# - promoting private-public partnership. In particular, Leader will continue to play and important role in encouraging innovative approaches to rural development and bringing the private and public sectors together; #NP# - promoting cooperation and innovation. Local initiatives such as Leader and support for diversification can play an essential role in connecting people to new ideas and approaches, encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship and promote inclusiveness and the provision of local services. On-line communities can help in the dissemination of knowledge, the exchange of good practices and innovation in rural products and services; #NP# - improving local governance. Leader can help foster innovative approaches to linking agriculture, forestry and the local economy thereby helping to diversify the economic base and strengthen the socio-economic tissue of rural areas. #NP# 3.5. Translating priorities into programmes #NP# The resources devoted to the Community rural development priorities (within the regulatory minimum funding limits for each axis) will depend on the specific situation, strengths and weaknesses of each programme area. Each of the Community priorities, and their contribution to Lisbon and G√∂teborg objectives, will need to be translated into the Member State context in the national strategy plan and rural development programmes. In many cases, there will be national or regional priorities for specific problems related to the agrifood sector or the environmental, climatic and geographical situation of agriculture and forestry. Rural areas may have to deal with other specific issues such as peri-urban pressure, unemployment, remoteness or low population density. #NP# Guideline In working out their national strategies, Member States should ensure that synergies between and within the axes are maximised and potential contradictions avoided. They will also wish to reflect on how to take into account other EU level strategies such as the Action Plan for Organic Farming[21], the latest Commission Communication on Renewable Energy[22], the Commission‚Äôs recent Communication on Climate Change[23] and the need to anticipate the likely effects on farming and forestry, and the Commission‚Äôs report on the EU Forestry Strategy[24] (which can help deliver on both the growth and employment and the sustainability objectives) and the forthcoming thematic environmental strategies[25]. | #NP# Several means are available at EU and Member State level to improve governance and policy delivery. Technical assistance can be used to build up European and national networks for rural development, as a platform for exchange of best practice and expertise on all aspects of policy design, management and implementation between stakeholders. Information and publicity to ensure early involvement of the different actors will need to be considered in the preparation of the national strategies and worked out for the later stages of implementation. #NP# 3.6. Complementarity between Community Instruments #NP# Guideline The synergy between structural, employment and rural development policies needs to be encouraged. In this context, Member States should ensure complementarity and coherence between actions to be financed by the ERDF, Cohesion Fund, ESF, EFF and EAFRD on a given territory and in a given field of activity. The main guiding principles as regards the demarcation line and the coordination mechanisms between actions supported by the different Funds should be defined at the level of national strategic reference framework/national strategy plan. | #NP# For infrastructure investments, the scale of intervention could be a guiding principle. For example, for investments in transport and other infrastructure at the level of the Member State or region/sub-region, Cohesion policy instruments would be used, while at the very local level the basic services measure under axis 3 could be used, ensuring the link between local and regional levels. #NP# As regards the development of human capital, support under rural development would target farmers and the economic actors involved in the diversification of the rural economy. The population of rural areas could receive support as part of an integrated, bottom-up approach. Actions in these fields should be implemented in full compliance with the objectives of the European Employment Strategy, as set out in the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs and coherent with the actions taken under the national reform programmes in the framework of the Lisbon process. The Education and Training 2010 work programme seeks to achieve the education and the training side of the Lisbon goals. Lifelong learning is at the heart of this programme and applies to all levels and types of education and training, including the agricultural, forestry and agrifood sectors. #NP# 4. THE REPORTING SYSTEM #NP# The new rural development regulation foresees strategic monitoring of the Community and national strategies. The basis for reporting on progress will be the common framework for monitoring and evaluation to be established in cooperation with the Member States. #NP# The framework will provide a limited set of common indicators and a common methodology. It will be supplemented by programme-specific indicators to reflect the character of each programme area. #NP# A common set of indicators will allow aggregation of outputs, results and impacts at the EU level and help assess progress in achieving Community priorities. Baseline indicators defined at the start of the programming period will allow assessment of the starting situation and form the basis for the development of the programme strategy. #NP# Evaluation activities will take place on an ongoing basis, comprising at programme level ex-ante , mid-term, and ex-post evaluation as well as other evaluation activity considered useful for improving programme management and impact. These will be accompanied by thematic studies and synthesis evaluations at Community level, as well as by the activities of the European network for rural development as a platform for exchange and capacity building for evaluation in Member States. Exchange of good practices and the sharing of evaluation results can contribute significantly to the effectiveness of rural development. In this respect, the European network should play a central role in facilitating contacts. #NP# [1] OJ L ..., ‚Ä¶, p. ‚Ä¶ #NP# [2] OJ L ..., ‚Ä¶, p. ‚Ä¶ #NP# [3] OJ L ..., ‚Ä¶, p. ‚Ä¶ #NP# [4] OJ L ..., ‚Ä¶, p. ‚Ä¶ #NP# [5] Presidency Conclusions European Councils of Luxembourg 1997, Berlin 1999 and Brussels 2002, Agricultural Council, 14 March 2005. #NP# [6] The OECD definition is based on the share of population living in rural communes (i.e. with less than 150 inhabitants per km¬≤) in a given NUTS III region.

The proposal for a Regulation essentially retains the framework that was established in the previous programming periods. Besides this, it focuses on achieving greater simplification with regard to, in particular, financial instruments and the choice of themes and, more generally, implementation, management and control systems. The Court paid particular attention to the consequences of the measures proposed for financial management and control. #NP# Responsibility for the implementation of the Community budget #NP# 2. The legal framework for the implementation of the Community budget is set by Article 274 of the EC Treaty, according to which the Commission implements the budget on its own responsibility and in cooperation with the Member States, having regard to the principle of sound financial management. #NP# 3. In the context of the various methods for implementing the Community budget, structural measures are included among ""shared management"" areas, namely, areas in which ""implementation tasks shall be delegated to Member States"" [9]. The management and control of structural measures involve not only several Commission departments but also hundreds of national, regional and local offices and departments in the Member States. In future, these measures could account for nearly half of the appropriations in the Community budget. #NP# 4. The rules currently governing structural measures (Regulation No 1260/1999) already provide as follows: #NP# (a) that ""in application of the principle of subsidiarity, the implementation of assistance shall be the responsibility of the Member States, (‚Ä¶) without prejudice to the powers vested in the Commission, notable for implementing the general budget of the European Communities"" (Article 8(3)); #NP# (b) that ""without prejudice to Article 8(3), the managing authority (‚Ä¶) shall be responsible for the efficiency and correctness of management and implementation (‚Ä¶)"" (Article 34(1)); #NP# (c) that ""without prejudice to the Commission's responsibility for implementing the general budget of the European Communities, Member States shall take responsibility in the first instance for the financial control of assistance (‚Ä¶)"" (Article 38(1)). #NP# 5. The proposal for a Regulation refers, in Article 12, to shared management within the meaning of Article 53(3) of the Financial Regulation. However, the wording of the proposal contains no reference to the Commission's final responsibility. For instance, it is specified in the last sentence of Article 12(1) that ""the Member States and the Commission shall ensure compliance with the principle of sound financial management"", Article 12(2) essentially limits the Commission's responsibility for implementing the budget to checking ""the existence and proper functioning of management and control systems in the Member States (‚Ä¶)"", and Article 69(1) makes the Member States alone responsible: ""Member States shall be responsible for ensuring sound financial management of operational programmes and the legality and regularity of underlying transactions"". What is more, it is the Member States that are assigned a general obligation to guarantee that assistance measures comply with Community law (Articles 39(f), 59(a), 60(b)(ii) and 66(2)(g)). Yet the fact that implementation tasks are entrusted to the Member States cannot limit the Commission‚Äôs final responsibility. In a context where the Member States are both beneficiaries of the Community funds and responsible for the implementation of measures, only the Commission is able to ensure that the Community objectives are applied in a logical and consistent manner. It is therefore crucial that the notion of the Commission's final responsibility, as envisaged in Article 274 of the Treaty, be reaffirmed unequivocally in the articles that deal with the responsibility of Member States. #NP# 6. It is worth noting that if the Commission no longer had final responsibility for implementing the budget, the Community's financial process, and in particular the discharge procedure, would lose a good deal of its significance. The budgetary authorities' recommendations (Article 276(3) of the EC Treaty) would be deprived of all practical effect. #NP# The proposed regulatory framework #NP# The conditions for an adequate control framework #NP# 7. In order that the Commission can assume its ultimate responsibility for the implementation of the budget, the proposal for a Regulation should take into account the following key aspects, which underpin opinion No 2/2004 of the Court on the ""single audit"" model: #NP# (i) The intensity of the checks #NP# 8. There is no indication in the current legislation of the intensity of the checks at final beneficiary level, which should rely on a comparison of the costs to be borne by the Member States and the Commission in connection with the controls and the related benefits. The proposal only indirectly addresses the need to set acceptable confidence and materiality thresholds (Article 61(1)(e)(ii) and 61(1)(g)). It would be desirable to explicitly provide for appropriate criteria in the implementing rules specified in Article 58(6). The terms ""reasonable assurance"" and ""validity of the application"" should also be defined. #NP# (ii) Definition of appropriate standards #NP# 9. The reference to ""international audit standards"" (Article 61(1)(a)) is not sufficiently explicit to allow the control procedures to be based on common norms and principles. There should be provision in the implementing rules mentioned above for a preliminary acceptance procedure covering both the system‚Äôs audit and the audit of the operations themselves. #NP# (iii) Organisation of the management and control systems #NP# 10. Article 54 of the Financial Regulation specifies that the implementing tasks delegated must be clearly defined and fully supervised as to the use made of them. Article 35(1) of the implementing rules states that, where management is shared, the Commission will first carry out documentary and on-the-spot checks into the existence, relevance and proper operation of the procedures and systems within the entities to which it entrusts implementation. The proposal for a Regulation departs from these provisions in that, prior to the Commission's adoption of an operational programme, only the Member States are required to ensure that management and control systems have been set up (Article 70). In this context, it would be desirable to make arrangements, if not for an approval procedure, then at least for the Commission to oversee the procedures by which management and control bodies are appointed at national level. Moreover, it would also be advisable to set up an intermediary body at national level to ensure liaison with the Community authorities. #NP# 11. A substantial strengthening of Community controls is the indispensable corollary to a system in which project management rests with the national or regional authorities [10]. Given that the rules on the eligibility of expenditure will, from now on, be largely fixed at national level, the conditions outlined above will be of even greater importance. #NP# Responsibility in the area of legality and regularity #NP# 12. Article 60(1) of the Financial Regulation makes the authorising officer responsible for ensuring the legality and regularity of expenditure. In Article 53(6), the Regulation also states that, where management is shared, the Member States are to conduct regular checks to ensure that the actions to be financed from the Community budget have been implemented correctly. They are also to take appropriate measures to prevent irregularities and fraud and if necessary bring prosecutions to recover funds wrongly paid. #NP# 13. In the light of these provisions, the proposal for a Regulation (Article 69(1)) confers upon the Member States responsibility for the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions (see paragraph 5). The ensuing transfer of competence to the Member States also comes as a corollary to the stipulation in Article 70 that they are to approve the management and control systems. #NP# 14. It is true that, where there are doubts as to the operation of these systems, or where irregularities are suspected or confirmed, the Commission could interrupt payment for a period of six to twelve months (Article 89). It is also envisaged that the Member States and the Commission could adopt financial corrections (Articles 99 and 100). However, such measures could provide no more than a limited, auxiliary contribution to the necessary rigour of everyday management. Their effectiveness is essentially dependent on the number of checks performed. Furthermore, since financial corrections would intervene only after the fact, they could not be enough on their own to make good all the consequences of any transactions that might be implemented even though they did not meet the necessary regulatory requirements. #NP# Responsibility in the area of sound financial management #NP# 15. Article 60(1) of the Financial Regulation indicates that the authorising officer is to implement expenditure in accordance with the principles of sound financial management. Article 27 of the Regulation sets out the conditions for the use of Community appropriations in accordance with the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The same Article states that specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timed objectives are to be set for all budget activities. The Commission is to undertake ex ante and ex post evaluations which it then forwards to the spending, legislative and budgetary authorities. #NP# 16. The proposal for a Regulation makes the Member States responsible for sound financial management (Article 69). However, this provision does no more than refer to the existence of ""adequate guidance"" on setting up management and control systems that will ensure that community financing is used ""efficiently and correctly"". On the matter of effectiveness [11], the proposal refers almost exclusively to the management and control systems, and by implication to those governing only legality and regularity. Article 59 of the proposal is limited to making the managing authority responsible for managing and implementing programmes ""efficiently, effectively and correctly"" and finally refers, in indent (e), to the quality standards agreed between the Commission and the Member States in respect of ex ante evaluations. #NP# 17. Concerning the narrower question of evaluations, the proposal for a Regulation specifies that the evaluation methods and standards to be applied (Article 45(5)) are to be agreed between the Commission and the Member States (Article 59(e)). The quality of these standards will be of particular importance for the ex ante evaluations entrusted to the Member States (Articles 46(2) and 46(3)), which must inter alia identify the added value that operational programmes bring to the Community. #NP# 18. lt is therefore particularly important that the implementing rules that the Commission is to adopt pursuant to Article 58(6) of the proposal for a Regulation provide all the necessary clarification of these aspects. #NP# Conservation of supporting documents #NP# 19. Article 88 of the proposal for a Regulation says that supporting documents concerning expenditure are to be kept available for the Commission and the Court of Auditors for a period of at least three years following closure. In the case of co-financed assistance, where the eligibility of the expenditure is largely dependent on national legislation, it would be desirable to state explicitly that the three-year term is without prejudice to national rules specifying longer periods. #NP# 20. These remarks apply also to the partial closure of operational programmes (Article 97). In this specific case by derogation from the general rule (Article 88), the period for conserving supporting documents would start on the date of partial closure (Article 98(2)). This would have the effect of seriously limiting checks on an operational programme as a whole at the end of the programming period, since the supporting documents for operations closed earlier might no longer be available. In the Court's view, such an eventuality could encroach upon its audit prerogatives as specified in Article 248 of the EC Treaty. #NP# More effective programmes #NP# Programming and setting objectives #NP# 21. The proposal stipulates that each Member State is to draw up a ""national strategic reference framework"" that is consistent with the ""Community guidelines on economic, social and territorial cohesion"" to be adopted by the Council (Article 23). However, there is no reference under the ""national strategic reference framework"" to the ""European territorial cooperation"" objective. #NP# 22. The content of the ""national strategic reference framework"" (Article 25) is not sufficiently precise (in terms of measures, the allocation of resources and expected results) to provide detailed information on the national and regional development strategy. Neither are the ""thematic and territorial priorities"", which are supposed to define the measures to be financed, explained adequately. This framework is also likely to be limited exclusively to areas where assistance is co-financed. Thus the Commission, which is required to adopt the frameworks, would not be in a position to emphasise some or other aspect in the operational programmes. #NP# 23. The operational programmes are also characterised by a lack of precision, no information being requested in respect of the various measures to achieve the priority objectives. This prevents any arbitration between measures. Specific objectives would be quantified by means of a limited number of implementation, results and impact indicators. Compared with the current legislation, a description of the arrangements for managing each operational programme is no longer required (Article 36). Thus, neither the ""national strategic reference framework"", nor the operational programmes would be true management and monitoring instruments for the Commission. It is consequently unclear how the Commission will be able to ensure that coordination with the operational programmes has been established at national level. #NP# Improved integration of assistance measures #NP# 24. The extended impact assessment fails to address the reasons for maintaining separate Funds (as opposed to grouping the Funds as postulated in Article 161 of the EC Treaty). However, this should have been the subject of a thorough analysis from the point of view of the advantages and disadvantages of all the available options, given that the extended impact assessment gives arguments in favour of setting up a single Fund. As regards the present Objective 2, in fact, it says that the relative thematic diversity of funded projects and the fragmentation caused by zoning have blocked the implementation of suitable policies. Moreover, it has not been possible to exploit sufficiently the ERDF/ESF synergies under Objective 3. It is therefore concluded that there is a need for: #NP# - a greater concentration of themes to promote competitiveness, #NP# - greater complementarity, over and above the ""Convergence"" objective, between the ERDF and the ESF. #NP# 25. Establishing the principle of ""one Fund/one operational programme"", in the interest of simplification is not likely to promote the search for the necessary synergies. #NP# 26. It is especially difficult to justify the separation between the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund in the context of the ""Convergence"" objective. These two Funds are generally to be found in the same operational programmes and are concerned with the same themes (transport infrastructure and environmental projects/actions). The corresponding actions/projects are often complementary (for example, where the Cohesion Fund and the ERDF are both used to finance different parts of a motorway). What distinguishes them are regional/State eligibility (per capita GDP of less than 75 % of the Community average in the case of the Structural Funds, and per capita GNI of less than 90 % of the Community average), the contribution ceiling, Article 51 gives 85 % for the Cohesion Fund and 75 % for the ERDF, although the ERDF ceiling may be increased to 85 % in certain cases (Articles 51(4) and 52(1)), and the matter of pre-financing (Article 81), which amounts to 7 % for the Structural Funds and 10,5 % for the Cohesion Fund. ERDF actions and Cohesion Fund projects are often managed by the same public entities. The concepts of major projects and revenue-generating projects are equally valid for both Funds. For reasons of consistency it would be appropriate to operate a single Fund, at least in the case of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, since the differences given above do not constitute major obstacles. #NP# 27. Looking at Article 3(2) of the proposal, it is difficult to draw a clear line between actions concerned by indent (a) and those concerned by indent (b). The real difference appears to be ""territorial"" (eligible areas) as compared with ""financial"" (contribution levels). #NP# 28. From a practical point of view, the provision of Article 33 (financing from a single Fund, with no more than 5 % from any other Fund) is a further complication arising from the existence of multiple Funds. #NP# Adequacy of the Commission's administrative capacity #NP# 29. In the past, the Court has noted [12] several delays during the different stages of programming or during the performance of checks for which the responsibility must lie with Commission departments. It is therefore vital that administrative structures and adequate procedures be established. Moreover, precise deadlines should be laid down in several of the provisions proposed (Articles 31(5), 32(2), 40(3), 85(2) and 96(1)). It would also be useful to have the departments responsible for the different Funds reach a common accord on the audit strategy, the allocation of resources and the required level of assurance. #NP# SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS #NP# 30. The Court sets out specific observations in the table below. In this section the imprecision of certain time limits and certain expressions used is noted on several occasions. This runs the risk of giving rise to differing interpretations and undermining the legal scope of the provisions concerned. #NP# COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL | THE COURT'S OBSERVATIONS | #NP# 1.The action taken by the Community under Article 158 of the Treaty shall be designed to strengthen the economic and social cohesion of the enlarged Community in order to promote the harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of the Community. This action shall be taken with the aid of the Funds, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and other existing financial instruments. It shall be aimed at meeting the challenges linked to the economic, social and territorial disparities which have arisen particularly in countries and regions whose development is lagging behind, to the speeding-up of economic and social restructuring, and to the ageing of the population. The action taken under the Funds shall incorporate, at national and regional level, the Community's priorities in favour of sustainable development by strengthening growth, competitiveness and employment, social inclusion, as well as the protection and quality of the environment. | The reference to action taken under Article 158 of the EC Treaty is incomplete in that it omits rural development. However, it is stated in Article 3(3) that assistance under the Funds is to support, in an appropriate manner, the renewal of rural areas and areas dependent on fisheries through economic diversification, as well as mountain areas. | #NP# 2.To that end, the ERDF, the ESF, the Cohesion Fund, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other existing Community financial instruments shall each contribute in an appropriate way towards achieving the following three objectives:(a)the ""Convergence"" objective shall be aimed at speeding up the convergence of the least-developed Member States and regions by improving conditions for growth and employment through increasing and improving the quality of investment in physical and human capital, the development of innovation and of the knowledge society, the adaptability to economic and social changes, the protection and improvement of the environment as well as administrative efficiency. This objective shall constitute the priority of the Funds;(‚Ä¶) | The proposal includes ""administrative efficiency"" among the actions to be financed under the ""Convergence"" objective. The concept of ""administrative efficiency"", which also appears in Articles 25(3)(b) and 26(3)(c), needs to be clarified, especially since the proposal also uses the term ""administrative capacity"" (Article 44(1)). | #NP# 1.The regions eligible for funding from the Structural Funds under the ""Convergence"" objective shall be regions corresponding to level II of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (hereinafter NUTS level II) within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 whose per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), measured in purchasing power parities and calculated on the basis of Community figures for the last three years available on (‚Ä¶), is less than 75 % of the Community average.2.The NUTS level II regions whose per capita GDP, measured in purchasing power parities and calculated on the basis of Community figures for the last three years available on (‚Ä¶), is between 75 % and (‚Ä¶) % of the Community average shall be eligible, on a transitional and specific basis, for financing by the Structural Funds | It is not enough to use GDP alone to identify eligible regions because of the many dimensions of the development gap. Aspects that should not be overlooked include the availability of basic infrastructure, the unemployment rate, labour productivity, the economic structure, education and training, the quality of the environment, emigration and R %amp% D. | #NP# 2.The NUTS level II regions whose per capita GDP, measured in purchasing power parities and calculated on the basis of Community figures for the last three years available on (‚Ä¶), is between 75 % and (‚Ä¶) % of the Community average shall be eligible, on a transitional and specific basis, for financing by the Structural Funds. | The second percentage referring to the Community average needs to be inserted. | #NP# 1.The areas eligible for funding from the Structural Funds under the ""Regional competitiveness and employment"" objective shall be those not covered by Article 5(1) and 5(2). When presenting the national strategic reference framework referred to in Article 25, each Member State concerned shall indicate the NUTS I or NUTS II regions for which it will present a programme for financing by the ERDF. | It should be pointed out that the geographical scope of the ""Regional competitiveness and employment"" objective is potentially very broad and therefore all-embracing. Eligibility criteria need to be defined for this objective. | #NP# 1.For the purpose of cross-border cooperation, shall be eligible for financing the NUTS level III regions of the Community along the internal and certain external land borders and certain NUTS level III regions of the Community along the maritime borders separated, as a general rule, by a maximum of 150 kilometres, taking into account potential adjustments needed to ensure the coherence and continuity of the cooperation action. Immediately following the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall adopt, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 104(2) the list of the eligible regions. This list shall be valid from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.2.For the purpose of transnational cooperation, on the basis of the Community's strategic guidelines referred to in Articles 23 and 24, the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 104(2), shall adopt the list of the eligible transnational areas. This list shall be valid from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. | The description of the ""European territorial cooperation"" objective should have been preceded by an analysis of the situation in these areas and a clear definition of their needs with a view to concentrating activities. The provisions on the choice of eligible areas should be expanded to include criteria that are precisely defined and, more particularly, weighted. | #NP# 3.Each year the Commission shall consult the organisations representing the social partners at European level on assistance from the Funds. | Article 10(1)(b) refers to the economic and social partners. It would be desirable to use the same expression in paragraph 3. | #NP# 1.Contributions from the Structural Funds shall not replace public or equivalent structural expenditure by a Member State.2.For regions covered by the ""Convergence"" objective, the Commission and the Member State shall determine the level of public or equivalent structural expenditure which the Member State shall maintain in all the regions concerned during the programming period. That expenditure shall be agreed by the Member State and the Commission within the national strategic reference framework referred to in Article 25.3.The level of the expenditure referred to in paragraph 2 shall be at least equal to the amount of average annual expenditure in real terms attained during the previous programming period. The level of expenditure shall be determined with reference to the general macroeconomic conditions in which the financing is carried out and taking into account certain specific economic situations, namely privatisations as well as an exceptional level of public or equivalent structural expenditure by the Member State during the previous programming period.4.The Commission shall, in cooperation with each Member State, verify additionality mid-term in 2011 and ex post by 30 June 2016 for the ""Convergence"" objective. Where a Member State is unable to prove on 30 June 2016 that the additionality agreed within the national strategic reference framework has been respected, the Commission shall proceed to a financial correction in accordance with procedure laid down in Article 101. | A procedure verifying the application of the additionality principle is only envisaged for the ""Convergence"" objective. There is no such provision for the other two objectives, which account for around 20 % of appropriations. Only section 5.3 of the explanatory memorandum specifies that this control is to be exercised by the Member States in accordance with the proportionality principle. Neither does the Commission have to be informed of the results of controls by the Member States. This represents a change compared with the current legislation (Article 11(3) of Regulation No 1260/99). | #NP# 3.The level of the expenditure referred to in paragraph 2 shall be at least equal to the amount of average annual expenditure in real terms attained during the previous programming period.The level of expenditure shall be determined with reference to the general macroeconomic conditions in which the financing is carried out and taking into account certain specific economic situations, namely privatisations as well as an exceptional level of public or equivalent structural expenditure by the Member State during the previous programming period. | The possibility of taking account of the general macroeconomic circumstances as well as certain specific economic situations, without further explanation, potentially leaves enormous scope for discretion. | #NP# 1.Overall resources for the ""Convergence"" objective shall amount to 78,54 % of the resources referred to in the first paragraph of Article 15 (i.e. a total of EUR 264,0 billion) and shall be distributed between the different components as follows:(a)67,34 % for the financing referred to in Article 5(1), using eligible population, regional prosperity, national prosperity and unemployment as the criteria for calculating the indicative breakdowns by Member State;(b)8,38 % for the transitional and specific support referred to in Article 5(2), using eligible population, regional prosperity, national prosperity and unemployment as criteria for calculating the indicative breakdowns by Member State;(c)23,86 % for the financing referred to in Article 5(3), using population, per capita GNI taking into account of the improvement in national prosperity over the previous period, and surface area as criteria for calculating the indicative breakdowns by Member State; and(d)0,42 % for the financing referred to in Article 5(4), using eligible population as criteria for calculating the indicative breakdowns by Member State. | It would be helpful to indicate how the criteria were weighted to determine the allocation of Funds to the different components. | #NP# 2.The annual breakdown of the appropriations referred to in paragraph 1(b) shall be degressive from 1 January 2007. The appropriation in 2007 shall be lower than in 2006, except for those regions that are not fully eligible to Objective 1 on 1 January 2000 pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 for which the appropriation in 2007 shall be objective and fair. | The text does not define what is meant by ""objective and fair"". | #NP# 1.Overall resources for the ""Regional competitiveness and employment"" objective shall amount to 17,22 % of the resources referred to in the first paragraph of Article 15 (i.e. a total of EUR 57,9 billion) and shall be distributed between the different components as follows:(a)83,44 % for the financing as referred to in Article 6(1), using eligible population, regional prosperity, unemployment, employment rate and population density as the criteria for calculating the indicative breakdowns by Member State; and(b)16,56 % for the transitional and specific support referred to in Article 6(2), using eligible population, regional prosperity, national prosperity and unemployment as the criteria for calculating the indicative breakdowns by Member State. | It would be helpful to indicate how the criteria were weighted to determine the allocation of Funds to the different components. | #NP# 2.The appropriations referred to in paragraph 1(a) shall be divided equally between the programmes financed by the ERDF and the programmes financed by the ESF. 2. | The text should clarify how the division between the ERDF and the ESF is to be made. | #NP# 4.The annual breakdowns of the appropriations referred to in paragraph 1(b) shall be degressive from 1 January 2007. The appropriations in 2007 shall be lower than in 2006, except for those regions whose eligibility to Objective 1 pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 started in 2004 for which the appropriation in 2007 shall be objective and fair. | The text does not define what is meant by ""objective and fair"". | #NP# The Commission ensures that total annual allocations from the Funds for any Member State pursuant to this Regulation, including the contribution of the ERDF to the financing of the cross-border strand of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument pursuant to Regulation (EC) No (‚Ä¶) and of the Instrument for pre-accession pursuant to Regulation (EC) No (‚Ä¶), and from the part of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No (‚Ä¶) originating from the EAGGF, Guidance section, and of the European Fund for Fisheries (EFF) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No (‚Ä¶) contributing to the ""Convergence"" objective, shall not exceed 4 % of that Member State's GDP as estimated at the time of the adoption of the Interinstitutional Agreement.The Regulations of the financial instruments mentioned in the previous paragraph other than the Funds include a similar provision. | Concerning the total annual allocations from the Funds for any Member State, the idea put forward in recital 30 of the preamble, namely, that annual appropriations should be allocated with regard to the Member States' capacity for absorption, has not been taken up. | #NP# At the latest three months after the adoption of this Regulation, the Community strategic guidelines referred to in Article 23 are adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 161 of the Treaty. This decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The Community strategic guidelines shall be subject, if necessary, to mid-term review in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 161 of the Treaty, in order to take account in particular of changes in the priorities of the Community. | It is also necessary to question the effects on the frameworks of any amendment to the Community strategic guidelines. There is in fact no provision for a revision of the frameworks in any of the articles. | #NP# 3.The strategic section of the national strategic reference framework shall specify the strategy chosen for the ""Convergence"" objective and the ""Regional competitiveness and employment"" objective, demonstrating how the choices made are consistent with the Community strategic guidelines on the basis of an analysis of development disparities, weaknesses and potential related, in particular, to the expected changes in the European and world economies. It shall specify:(‚Ä¶)(b)for the ""Convergence"" objective only, the action envisaged for reinforcing the Member State's administrative efficiency, including as regards management of the Funds, and the evaluation plan referred to in Article 46(1);(‚Ä¶) | It is stated here that the chosen strategy is to specify ""the action envisaged for reinforcing the Member State‚Äôs administrative efficiency, including as regards management of the Funds"". This implies that the notion of ""reinforcing the Member State‚Äôs administrative efficiency"" could go beyond the management of the Funds, bringing with it the risk that a very wide range of operations would be financed. | #NP# 3.The strategic section of the national strategic reference framework shall specify the strategy chosen for the ""Convergence"" objective and the ""Regional competitiveness and employment"" objective, demonstrating how the choices made are consistent with the Community strategic guidelines on the basis of an analysis of development disparities, weaknesses and potential related, in particular, to the expected changes in the European and world economies. It shall specify:(‚Ä¶)In order to permit monitoring, the main goals of the priorities referred to in point a) shall be quantified and a limited number of performance and impact indicators shall be identified. | It is inappropriate to specify ""a limited number"" without giving further detail. What matters most is that the chosen indicators should enable the results achieved, and the impact of those results, to be adequately expressed. | #NP# 4.For the ""Convergence"" objective and the ""Regional competitiveness and employment"" objective, the operational section shall contain:(a)the list of operational programmes and the indicative annual allocation from each Fund by programme, ensuring an appropriate balance between regional and thematic action. This list shall include the amount of the national contingency reserve referred to in Article 49;(‚Ä¶) | What is meant by ""an appropriate balance"" is not defined. | #NP# 2.Each Member State shall send the Commission a proposal for a national strategic reference framework as soon as possible after adoption of the Community strategic guidelines. Member States may decide to present at the same time the operational programmes referred to in Article 31. The Commission negotiates this proposal in the framework of the partnership. | The phrase ""as soon as possible"" should be replaced with an exact deadline. | #NP# The report of the Commission referred to in Article 159, second subparagraph, of the Treaty shall include in particular:(a)a record of the progress made on economic and social cohesion, including the socio-economic situation and development of the regions, as well as the integration of the Community priorities;(b)a record of the role of the Funds, the EIB and the other financial instruments, as well as the effect of other Community and national policies on the progress made. The report shall contain, if necessary, any proposals on Community measures and policies which should be adopted in order to strengthen economic and social cohesion. It shall also propose, if necessary, proposals concerning any adjustments linked to new Community policy initiatives in the strategic guidelines on cohesion. In the year in which the report is presented, it shall replace the annual report by the Commission referred to in Article 28. It shall be the subject of an annual debate in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 29. | It would be advisable to stipulate that the cohesion report should also address the territorial dimension of cohesion. | #NP# 3.The Member State shall submit a proposal for an operational programme to the Commission containing all the components referred to in Article 36, as soon as possible following the Commission decision referred to in Article 26 or at the same of the presentation of the national strategic reference framework referred to in the same Article 26. | The phrase ""as soon as possible"" should be replaced with an exact deadline. | #NP# 5.The Commission shall adopt each operational programme as soon as possible after its formal submission by the Member State. | The phrase ""as soon as possible"" should be replaced with an exact deadline (the deadline is currently five months). | #NP# The Commission shall adopt a decision on the requests for revision of operational programmes as soon as possible after formal submission of the request by the Member State. | The phrase ""as soon as possible"" should be replaced with an exact deadline. | #NP# 4.The Commission may, if it considers it appropriate for the appraisal of major projects, request the EIB to examine those projects' technical quality and economic and financial viability, in particular as regards the financial engineering instruments to be implemented or developed. | The fourth paragraph is different in nature from the other three and would surely be more appropriate as part of Article 40. | #NP# 1.Operational programmes relating to the ""Convergence"" and the ""Regional competitiveness and employment"" objectives shall contain:(‚Ä¶)(c)an information on the priorities and their specific targets. Those targets shall be quantified using a limited number of indicators for implementation, results and impact, taking into account the proportionality principle. The indicators must make it possible to measure the progress in relation to the baseline situation and the effectiveness of the targets implementing the priorities;(‚Ä¶) | What is meant by ""a limited number of indicators ‚Ä¶, taking into account the proportionality principle"" should be clarified. | #NP# 4.Operational programmes financed by the ERDF shall contain in addition for the ""Convergence"" and the ""Regional competitiveness and employment"" objective:(a)actions for inter-regional cooperation with, at least, one region of another Member State in each regional programme;(‚Ä¶) | The actions concerned correspond more closely to the ""European territorial cooperation"" objective. | #NP# 3.The Commission shall adopt a decision as soon as possible after the submission by the Member State or the managing authority of all the information referred to in Article 39. That decision shall define the physical object, the amount to which the co-financing rate for the priority applies, and the annual schedule. | The phrase ""as soon as possible"" should be replaced with an exact deadline. | #NP# 3.The evaluation activities referred to in paragraph 1 shall be organised under the responsibility of the Member State or the Commission, as appropriate, in accordance with the principle of proportionality and on the basis of a partnership between the Member State and the Commission. Evaluations shall be carried out by independent assessors. The results shall be published, except where the authority responsible for the evaluation expressly objects in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on access to documents. | The ""principle of proportionality"" is not defined. | #NP# 5.During the programming period, Member States carry out ad hoc evaluation linked to the monitoring of operational programmes where the monitoring of programmes reveals a significant departure from the goals initially set and where proposals are made for the revision of operational programmes. The results shall be sent to the monitoring committee for the operational programme and to the Commission. | The text does not define what is meant by ""a significant departure from the goals initially set"" and ""the revision of operational programmes"".This observation only refers to the French version of the proposal. The adjective ""substantiel"" does not appear in all languages. | #NP# 1.Within the context of the annual debate referred to in Article 29, the Council shall in 2011, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 161 of the Treaty, allocate the reserve referred to in Article 20 among the Member States to reward progress made as compared with the initial situation:(a)for the ""Convergence"" objective, on the basis of the following criteria:(i)growth in the per capita gross domestic product measured at NUTS II level, in relation to the Community average, on the basis of the data available for the 2004 to 2010 period;(ii)growth in the employment rate at NUTS II level, on the basis of the data available for the 2004 to 2010 period;(b)for the ""Regional competitiveness and employment"" objective, on the basis of the following criteria:(i)pro rata to those regions having spent between 2007 and 2010 at least 50 % of their ERDF allocation on innovation-related activities as referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No (‚Ä¶);(ii)growth in the employment rate at NUTS II level, on the basis of the data available for the 2004 to 2010 period.2.Each Member State shall allocate the amounts concerned among operational programmes taking into account the criteria referred to in the previous paragraph 1. | Use of the performance reserve will essentially depend on criteria for which it is extremely difficult to establish a direct link with the actions benefiting from Community assistance. Changes in GDP and the employment rate are dependent on factors that are far more complex than the operational programmes alone, whose financial impact, moreover, is generally more limited than that of public investment as a whole. Furthermore, it appears restrictive to consider only the upward movement of indicators, as the structural measures may well have contributed towards cushioning a fall. | #NP# The contribution of the Funds shall be modulated in the light of the following:(a)the gravity of the specific problems, in particular of an economic, social or territorial nature;(b)the importance of each priority for the Community's priorities as set out in the strategic guidelines of the Community;(c)protection and improvement of the environment, principally through the application of the precautionary principle, the principle of preventive action, and the polluter-pays principle;(d)the rate of mobilisation of private financing, in particular under public-private partnerships, in the fields concerned. | The text should give weightings for the criteria to be applied for modulations of the contribution rates. | #NP# 2.Public expenditure on revenue-generating projects shall be calculated on the basis of the investment cost less the current value of the net revenue from the investment over a specific reference period. The calculation shall take account of the profitability normally expected of the category of investment concerned and of the application of the polluter-pays principle, and, if necessary, of the principle of equity linked to the relative prosperity of the Member State concerned. | The criteria used to apply the ""polluter pays"" principle and the principle of equity linked to the Member States' relative prosperity are not defined. The Commission should provide methodological support for the setting of assistance levels for these projects (see Article 40(2)). | #NP# 1.Expenditure shall be eligible for a contribution from the Funds if it has actually been incurred by the beneficiary for carrying out an operation between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2015. Operations co-financed must not have been completed before the starting date for eligibility. Expenditure on major projects shall be eligible from the date of submission of the project to the Commission. | It might be beneficial to relax these conditions to take account of preparatory work on the actions to be financed. The eligibility period could thus start on 1 July 2006. | #NP# 3.The rules on the eligibility of expenditure shall be laid down at national level subject to the exception provided in the specific Regulations for each Fund. They cover the entirety of the public expenditure declared under the operational programme. | It will be difficult to apply national eligibility rules in the context of the ""European territorial cooperation"" objective, as the operations financed concern more than one Member State. This aspect is not taken into account. | #NP# 1.The management and control systems of operational programmes set up by Member States shall provide for:(a)a clear definition of the functions of the bodies concerned in management and control and a clear allocation of functions within each body;(b)a clear separation of functions between bodies concerned in management, certification of expenditure and control and between those functions within each body;(c)adequate resources for each body to carry out the functions allocated to it;(d)effective internal audit arrangements;(e)reliable accounting, monitoring and financial reporting systems in computerised form;(f)an effective system of reporting and monitoring where the performance of tasks is delegated;(g)the existence of manuals of procedures for the functions to be performed;(h)effective arrangements for auditing the proper operation of the system;(i)systems and procedures to ensure an adequate audit trail;(j)reporting and monitoring procedures of irregularities and of recovery of amounts unduly paid. | Subparagraph (j) refers to ""irregularities"". A precise definition would be useful, especially since this notion appears in a number of clauses (for example, Articles 69(3), 73(4), 89(1) and 99). The value of this provision is limited at present by the lack of clarity concerning the data to be submitted. | #NP# 2.The measures laid down in paragraph 1(b), (c), (d), (f), and (h) shall be proportionate to public expenditure under the operational programme concerned. | It is envisaged that a number of the measures set out in this article would be applied in proportion to public expenditure under the operational programme concerned. However, this notion is insufficiently clear for the measures to be applied with any consistency. For this reason, it is difficult to imagine applying the measures in question (separation of functions, adequate resources and arrangements for internal audit, reporting and the systems audit) in a proportionate way. Moreover, this derogation does not apply to manuals of procedure, and no definition is given. It should also be specified whether the proportionality principle is supposed to apply to Articles 13 (verification of the additionality principle exclusively in the case of the ""Convergence"" objective), 46(3) (overall or specific ex ante evaluation), 66(2) (content of the annual and final implementation reports) and 73 (control procedures). | #NP# 1.The Audit Authority of an operational programme shall be responsible in particular for:(‚Ä¶)(b)ensuring that audits are carried out on operations on the basis of an appropriate sample to verify expenditure declared;(‚Ä¶) | The notion of an ""appropriate sample"" should be defined in the implementing rules. In any case, the requirements should not be less rigorous than for the 2000 to 2006 period. | #NP# 1.The Audit Authority of an operational programme shall be responsible in particular for:(‚Ä¶)(c)presenting to the Commission, within six months of the approval of the operational programme, an audit strategy covering the bodies which will perform the audits referred to under subparagraphs (a) and (b), the method to be used, the sampling method for audits on operations and the indicative planning of audits to ensure that the main bodies are audited and that audits are spread evenly throughout the programming period;(‚Ä¶) | This clause refers to ensuring that the ""main bodies"" are audited, yet without defining what those bodies are. | #NP# 1.The Audit Authority of an operational programme shall be responsible in particular for:(‚Ä¶)(e)by 30 June each year from 2008 to 2016:(i)establishing an annual control report setting out the findings of the audits carried out in accordance with the audit strategy in respect of the operational programme during the previous year and reporting any shortcomings found in the systems for the management and control of the programme. The information concerning years the 2014 and 2015 may be included in the final report to accompany the declaration of validity;(ii)issuing an opinion as to whether the management and control system has operated effectively to give a reasonable assurance on the correctness of the statements of expenditure presented to the Commission during that year and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions;(‚Ä¶) | The Commission's assurance concerning the audit of operational programmes is largely dependent upon the audit authority's submission of an annual control report accompanied by an opinion. However, owing to the deadline for submitting these documents (30 June), it will not be possible to take them into consideration either in the annual declarations to be drawn up by the Directors-General or in the statements of assurance prepared by the Court of Auditors. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to the annual report that is the subject of Article 66. | #NP# 2.At its own initiative, a representative of the Commission may participate in the work of the monitoring committee in an advisory capacity. A representative of the EIB and the EIF may participate in an advisory capacity for those operational programmes to which it makes a contribution. | In contrast with the current rules (see Article 35(2) of Regulation No 1260/1999), the Commission would participate in the monitoring committees at its own initiative. However, participation on these terms does appear desirable as a means of facilitating the exchange of information and the timely adoption of suitable measures. | #NP# 1.The Managing Authority and the Monitoring Committee shall ensure the quality of the implementation of the operational programme.2.The Managing Authority and the Monitoring Committee shall carry out monitoring by reference to financial indicators and indicators of implementation, results and impact specified in the operational programme. Where the nature of the assistance permits, the statistics shall be broken down by sex and by the size of the recipient undertakings.3.The Commission, in partnership with the Member States, shall examine the indicators necessary for monitoring and evaluating the operational programme. | It should be stated as a principle that all co-financed projects will carry implementation objectives and be subject to the evaluation of results specified in Article 65. Priority-based management is all too likely to produce only general information. | #NP# 2.The reports referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the following information in order to obtain a clear view of the implementation of the operational programme:(‚Ä¶)(j)the use made of assistance repaid to the Managing Authority or to another public authority during the period of implementation of the operational programme. The breadth of information transmitted to the Commission shall be proportional to the total amount of public expenditure of the operational programme concerned.(‚Ä¶) | The exact relationship between the breadth of information submitted and the amount of public expenditure should be clarified. | #NP# 1.For programmes for which the level of co-financing from Community funds does not exceed 33 % of public expenditure under the operational programme and the amount of the Funds does not exceed EUR 250 million, the provisions referred to in Article 61 points (c), (d), and (e)(i) do not apply.2.For the programmes referred to in paragraph 1, the Member State may exercise the option to establish according to national rules the bodies and procedures for carrying out the functions laid down in Articles 59(b), and in Articles 60 and 61. Where a Member State exercises this option, the provisions of Article 58(1)(b) and (c), and of Article 60(1)(c) shall not apply. When the Commission adopts the implementing rules of Articles 59, 60 and 61, it shall specify the provisions which shall not apply to those Member States which exercise the option referred to in the first subparagraph.3.Article 70(3) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, where a Member State exercises the option referred to in paragraph 2, first subparagraph.4.For all operational programmes referred to in paragraph 1, and irrespective of whether a Member State exercises the option referred to paragraph 2, where the opinion on the compliance of the system has no reservations, or where all reservations have been withdrawn following corrective measures, the Commission may inform the Member State concerned that it will rely principally on the opinion provided by the Audit Authority, or the body designated by the Member State where it has exercised the option referred to, as to the correctness, legality and regularity of expenditure declared and will carry out its own on-the-spot audits only in exceptional circumstances. In the event that there are indications of irregularities which have not been detected in a timely way by the national audit authorities or which have not been subject to appropriate corrective measures, the Commission may require the Member State to carry out audits in accordance with Article 71(3) or it may carry out its own audits under Article 71(2) in order to obtain assurance on the correctness, legality and regularity of expenditures declared. | In theory, this simplified procedure would apply during the 2000 to 2006 period to 33 programmes in 10 Member States, for Community aid worth a total of 3800 million euro (2 % of the Community aid budget for 2000 to 2006). This clause encourages Member States to take advantage of the associated simplification measures, and it could therefore concern more programmes than would in theory be calculated for the current programming period. Of particular interest in this connection is the exemption from the need to submit an audit strategy and an annual control report (Article 61(1)), the possibility of designating management and control bodies on the basis of national legislation (Articles 59 to 61) and the exemption from the need to designate certifying and audit authorities (Article 58(1)). Furthermore, when the report of the body stating compliance with the systems has been accepted by the Commission, the latter will carry out checks in exceptional cases only. | #NP# 2.For the programmes referred to in paragraph 1, the Member State may exercise the option to establish according to national rules the bodies and procedures for carrying out the functions laid down in Articles 59(b), and in Articles 60 and 61. Where a Member State exercises this option, the provisions of Article 58(1)(b) and (c), and of Articles 60(1)(c) shall not apply. When the Commission adopts the implementing rules of Articles 59, 60 and 61, it shall specify the provisions which shall not apply to those Member States which exercise the option referred to in the first subparagraph. | It should be possible to assess all the implications of the option of the first indent, and it is therefore not justified to refer to later implementing rules to specify which provisions will not apply. | #NP# 4.For all operational programmes referred to in paragraph 1, and irrespective of whether a Member State exercises the option referred to paragraph 2, where the opinion on the compliance of the system has no reservations, or where all reservations have been withdrawn following corrective measures, the Commission may inform the Member State concerned that it will rely principally on the opinion provided by the Audit Authority, or the body designated by the Member State where it has exercised the option referred to, as to the correctness, legality and regularity of expenditure declared and will carry out its own on-the-spot audits only in exceptional circumstances.In the event that there are indications of irregularities which have not been detected in a timely way by the national audit authorities or which have not been subject to appropriate corrective measures, the Commission may require the Member State to carry out audits in accordance with Article 71(3) or it may carry out its own audits under Article 71(2) in order to obtain assurance on the correctness, legality and regularity of expenditures declared. | The phrase ""‚Äòin a timely way""‚Äô should be replaced with an exact deadline. | #NP# Member States shall satisfy themselves that the body responsible for making the payments ensures that the beneficiaries receive the total amount of the contribution from public funds as quickly as possible and in full. No amounts shall be deducted or withheld, nor any further specific charge or other charge with equivalent effect shall be levied that would reduce these amounts for the beneficiaries. | The phrase ""as quickly as possible"" should be replaced with an exact deadline. | #NP# 2.If one of the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 is not met, the Member State and the certification authority shall be informed as soon as possible by the Commission that the payment request is unacceptable. | The phrase ""as soon as possible"" should be replaced with an exact deadline. | #NP# 1.The Commission shall decide to withhold from interim payments 20 % of the sums to be reimbursed by the Commission where the essential elements of the corrective action plan referred to in Article 70(3) have been implemented and the serious deficiencies referred to in the annual report by the audit authority for the programme referred to in Article 61, point (e)(i), have been rectified but amendments still need to be made to give the Commission reasonable assurance regarding the management and control systems. | Mention should also be made of the opinion referred to in Article 61(1)(e)(ii). | #NP# 1.The Commission shall inform the Member State and the authorities concerned in good time whenever there is a risk of application of the automatic decommitment provided for in Article 92. The Commission shall inform the Member State and the authorities concerned of the amount of the automatic decommitment resulting from the information in its possession.The Member State shall have two months' time from the date of receipt of that information to agree to the amount or submit its observations. The Commission shall carry out the automatic decommitment not later than nine months after the time limit referred to in Article 92. | What is meant by ""in good time"" should be clarified. | #NP# 1.Partial closure of operational programmes may be made at periods selected by the Member State.Partial closure shall relate to completed operations for which a final payment has been made to the beneficiary not later than 31 December of year n-1. For the purposes of this Regulation, operations shall be deemed completed where the activities under it have been actually carried out and the beneficiary has received a final payment or the beneficiary has provided a document of equivalent effect to the managing authority.2.The amount of payments corresponding to completed operations shall be identified in the statements of expenditure.Partial closure shall be made on condition that the managing authority sends the following to the Commission by 30 June of year n:a)a statement of expenditure relating to those operations;b)a statement certifying the legality and regularity of the transactions concerned by the statement of expenditure, issued by the audit authority for the programme referred to in Article 61. | It is important that the procedures provided for in the area of partial closures supply the same degree of assurance regarding the legality and regularity of expenditure as that which would result from the declaration on the final closure of the operational programme, in particular as regards the intensity and extent of the checks. | #NP# This Opinion was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg on 18 March 2005. #NP# For the Court of Auditors #NP# Hubert Weber #NP# President #NP# [1] OJ L 248, 16.9.2002. #NP# [2] Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 (OJ L 357, 31.12.2002). #NP# [3] COM(2004) 492 final of 14 July 2004. #NP# [4] SEC(2004) 924 of 14 July 2004. #NP# [5] COM(2004) 580 final of 6 September 2004. #NP# [6] COM(2004) 101 final of 10 February 2004. #NP# [7] COM(2004) 487 final of 14 July 2004. #NP# [8] OJ C 107, 30.4.2004. #NP# [9] Article 53(3) of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities. #NP# [10] See Opinion No 10/98 on certain proposals for regulation within the Agenda 2000 framework (Structural Funds, point 6.3) (OJ C 401, 22.12.1998). #NP# [11] For example Articles 57(d), (f) and (h), 61(1)(a), 70(1), 71(2) and 72(2). #NP# [12] See for example Special Report No 10/2001 (OJ C 314, 8.11.2001), concerning the financial control of the Structural Funds and Special Report No 7/2003 (OJ C 174, 23.7.2004), on the implementation of assistance programming for the period 2000 to 2006 within the framework of the Structural Funds. #NP# -------------------------------------------------- #S#  #S# ",1164;4056;1056;6285;929;5787;4038;5643,40;10;24,4021;1021;1011;2441;1006,1164;1005;5258;929;5620;1451,1164;5138;4056;1052;1460;1005;1056;6284;6285;5258;929;5590;5787;5620;1451;4038;5643,train

This proposal for a Council decision concerns the provisional application of the extension of the protocol for one more year, until 31 May 2006. #NP# The two parties agreed at the beginning of 2005 to extend the Agreement, in particular in order to iron out certain difficulties relating to the implementation of the 2002-05 Protocol and to give the Government of the Democratic Republic of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe more time to prepare itself as well as possible for negotiations on a future partnership agreement, and to implement the action programme to support the necessary development of the fisheries sector. The new government, which took office in March 2004, waited until the last minute to analyse the option of extending the protocol, despite numerous reminders in March, April and May 2005. #NP# The parties have finally decided to extend the Protocol for a period of one year, from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006. The extension, in the form of an exchange of letters, was initialled by the two parties on 3 June 2005, and sets out the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of EC vessels in the waters of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe for the period from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006. #NP# The Commission proposes, on this basis, that the Council adopt by decision the provisional application of the extension of the agreement, pending its definitive entry into force. #NP# A proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters on the extension of the Protocol is the subject of a separate procedure. #NP# Proposal for a #NP# COUNCIL DECISION #NP# on the signing on behalf of the European Community and provisional application of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters extending the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe on fishing off the coast of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe for the period from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006 #NP# THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 300(2) thereof, #NP# Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], #NP# Whereas: #NP# (1) Under the terms of the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe on fishing off the coast of S√£o Tom√© e Pr√≠ncipe[2], the contracting parties are to enter into negotiations, before the period of validity of the Protocol to the Agreement expires, to determine by mutual agreement the contents of the Protocol for the period that follows and, where applicable, the amendments or additions to be made to the Annex thereto. #NP# (2) Pending negotiations on changes to be made to the existing Protocol approved by Regulation (EC) No 2348/2002[3], the two parties have decided to extend its validity for one year by means of an Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters. #NP# (3) The exchange of letters provides Community fishermen with fishing opportunities in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006. #NP# (4) It is essential that the extension be applied as soon as possible in order to avoid interrupting the fishing activities of Community vessels. The Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters should therefore be signed and applied on a provisional basis pending the completion of the procedures required to conclude it. #NP# (5) The allocation of fishing opportunities among the Member States under the expired Protocol should be confirmed, #NP# HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: #NP# Article 1 #NP# The signature of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters extending the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe on fishing off the coast of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe for the period from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006 is hereby approved on behalf of the Community, pending the Council decision on conclusion of the Agreement. #NP# The text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision. #NP# Article 2 #NP# The Agreement shall apply provisionally from 1 June 2005. #NP# Article 3 #NP# The fishing opportunities set out in the Protocol are allocated to Member States as follows: #NP# - tuna seiners: | France: 18 Spain: 18 | #NP# - pole-and-line tuna vessels: | Portugal: 2 | #NP# - surface longliners: | Spain: 20 Portugal: 5 | #NP# If licence applications from these Member States do not cover all the fishing opportunities fixed by the Protocol, the Commission may take into consideration licence applications from any other Member State. #NP# Article 4 #NP# The Member States whose vessels fish under this Agreement shall notify the Commission of the quantities of each stock caught within the fishing zone of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 500/2001[4]. #NP# Article 5 #NP# The President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the persons empowered to sign the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters on behalf of the Community subject to its conclusion. #S# Done at Brussels, #NP# For the Council #NP# The President #NP# AGREEMENT #NP# in the form of an exchange of letters extending the Protocol setting out, for the period 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe on fishing off the coast of S√£o Tom√© e Pr√≠ncipe. #NP# A.

93,52005IE1263,en,2005,"Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the ""EESC position in preparation for the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference"" #NP# (2006/C 28/21) #NP# On 10 February 2005, the European Economic and Social Committee, acting under Rule 29(2) of its Rules of Procedure, decided to draw up an opinion on the: EESC position in preparation for the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference. #NP# The Section for External Relations, which was responsible for preparing the Committee's work on the subject, adopted its opinion on 10 October 2005. The rapporteur was Mr Nilsson. #NP# At its 421st plenary session held on 26 and 27 October 2005 (meeting of 27 October 2005), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 102 votes, 95 in favour, 4 abstentions and 3 against. #NP# Summary #NP# 1. The EESC believes that the success of the Hong Kong Ministerial would send a clear positive signal of confidence that Member States are committed to a strong multilateral trading system. This would also boost confidence in the global economy in the face of uncertainties caused by the oil shock, global security threats and growing protectionist pressures. #NP# 2. The EESC is concerned about the pace of negotiations leading up to the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference. Over the next few weeks impressive progress will have to be made in all fields to resolve some of the contentious issues and catch up with the pre-agreed negotiations timetable. #NP# 3. The EESC calls for a better distinction to be made among developing countries. The EESC reaffirms that provisions for special and differential treatment are an integral part of the WTO Agreements and should be followed through in the negotiations. The concerns of LDCs, in particular, should be taken into account. Trade Related Technical Assistance and capacity building should be provided to low-income countries for improving their participation in global trading. #NP# 4. The EESC considers that, by the Hong Kong meeting, Member States need to adopt a common position regarding the establishment of restrictions for all export support, the scope and arrangements for decreasing trade-distorting farm support, and a scheme for reducing customs duties that will both enhance market access and allow Member States the flexibility needed to preserve strategic agricultural sectors. #NP# 5. Success in the agricultural negotiations is key to ambitious results in other sectors of the negotiations. The EESC stresses that the EU has already made many concessions in the field of agriculture during these negotiations, such as the Everything but Arms initiative in 2001, the decoupling of CAP aid in 2003, and the commitment to eliminating export subsidies in 2004. It is now the task of other countries to make the requisite efforts to reach a global agreement. #NP# 6. The EESC reaffirms that, as regards NAMA, Member States should have an agreement on the structure of the tariff cutting formula and other key elements of the NAMA package, and fill in the needed figures at the Hong Kong meeting. #NP# 7. The EESC regrets the so far disappointing results in the services negotiations and supports a search for complementary services negotiating methods and modalities during the months leading up to the Hong Kong Ministerial. #NP# 8. The EESC considers that, as regards anti-dumping and subsidies matters, the Member States should at least have a general agreement on those issues where ministers should agree to launch legal text-based negotiations. #NP# 9. The EESC calls for the barriers to trade in environmental goods and services to be removed as soon as possible, and a list of environmental goods and services to be finalised in time for the Hong Kong Ministerial. #NP# 10. The EESC considers it important to incorporate internationally recognised ILO core labour standards into the international trading system and calls for the ILO to be granted the status of permanent observer to the WTO. The EESC feels it is necessary to push ahead with the global debate on social rights. #NP# 11. The EESC encourages civil society organisations to take steps to participate in information campaigns about the issues at stake on the Doha Agenda and contribute through their assessments and proposals to the success of sustainable development. It calls for institutionalised dialogue between the WTO and civil society and for greater involvement by organised civil society in the dispute settlement mechanism. #NP# 12. The democratic nature and transparency of the WTO should be further strengthened. The EESC has previously proposed that the WTO be given a parliamentary dimension. #NP# 1. Introduction #NP# 1.1 The EESC issued opinions setting out its views and positions prior to the two previous WTO Ministerial Conferences, viz. the fourth in Doha in 2001 [1] and the fifth in Canc√∫n in 2003 [2]. These opinions remain highly relevant. The new opinion in preparation for the Sixth Ministerial Conference to be held in Hong Kong in December 2005 will focus on the renewed negotiations now going on under the Doha Round (more correctly called the Doha Development Agenda ‚Äî DDA). #NP# 1.2 The Committee can also draw upon some previous EESC opinions that touch upon the ongoing WTO process, for example the opinion [3] on the Commission communication on the social dimension of globalisation [4]. Similarly, the work the EESC is currently undertaking as part of its cooperation with the ACP states deals specifically with issues that have a bearing on the WTO negotiations since the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) which will be drawn up in 2007 in the framework of the Cotonou Agreement have to comply with WTO agreements. In addition, the EESC adopted an opinion on the General agreement on trade in services (GATS) ‚Äî Mode 4 negotiations (temporary movement of physical persons) [5]. #NP# 1.3 The Doha Round was launched at the Fourth Ministerial Conference held in Doha in 2001. Though it is called the ""Doha Work Programme"" in official documents, it has subsequently come to be referred to as the ""Doha Development Agenda ‚Äî DDA"". The aim was to be able to complete the round of negotiations in January 2005. A mid-term review was conducted at the Fifth Ministerial Meeting in Canc√∫n, but the negotiations broke down when it proved impossible to conclude the meeting with a ministerial declaration. However, some progress was made on substantive issues. In July 2004 a renewed initiative was launched and the way was opened to a resumption of negotiations with the adoption of a decision (generally known as the July package) by the WTO General Council on 1 August. Negotiations were resumed with the aim of reaching an agreement by December 2005. Some mini-ministerial meetings have since been held in order to provide political input to the highly technical negotiations. The hope is now that enough progress will be made at the Sixth Ministerial Meeting in Hong Kong to enable the negotiations to be concluded during 2006. #NP# 1.4 With only a few weeks left to go before the Sixth Ministerial meeting gets under way in Hong Kong in December 2005 there is a serious lack of progress in all the negotiating areas. As things stand at present, there is little likelihood that the Doha Round can be concluded before the end of December 2005. There is a danger that if the talks at the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting break down, this could have a number of adverse consequences: #NP# - it would weaken the effectiveness of the WTO as an organisation; #NP# - there is a risk that multilateral negotiations under the auspices of the WTO would be abandoned in favour of bilateral or regional agreements, which would not serve the needs of the developing countries; #NP# - it would harm the global economy and confidence in economic growth and increase uncertainty about the future; #NP# - the fact that the US negotiating mandate from Congress expires on 30 June 2007 adds to the uncertainty and it is not clear that Congress will renew it. #NP# 2. Resumption of the Doha Round ‚Äî the EESC's position in the run-up to the 6th WTO Ministerial Conference #NP# 2.1 The Doha Agenda focuses particularly on the needs of developing countries. The areas which are currently the subject of negotiations and where agreement on trade liberalisation should be reached are, inter alia: #NP# - agriculture, where the issues are increased market access, cuts in trade-distorting domestic support and reductions in export credits; #NP# - non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA), which deals with increased market access for non-agricultural goods, i.e. industrial goods; #NP# - services, where the negotiations centre on increased market access under the framework of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS); #NP# - trade procedures; #NP# - special and Differential Treatment (SDP) ‚Äî Development Agenda, where the issues under consideration are of particular importance to the developing countries; #NP# - anti-dumping rules; #NP# - social issues; #NP# - environmental concerns. #NP# 3. The agricultural negotiations #NP# 3.1 The EESC also notes that the EU has been a prominent player in the agricultural negotiations. The EU has already implemented comprehensive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy and is also committed to phasing out existing export subsidies subject to two conditions: firstly, other countries must take equivalent action on all forms of direct and indirect export subsidies ‚Äî including food aid ‚Äî that are used to regulate the market. Secondly, as was pointed out by the European Commissioners for External Trade (Pascal Lamy) and for Agriculture (Franz Fischler) in a joint letter dated May 2004, this elimination of export subsidies will only be possible in the context of an agricultural agreement that strikes a balance between the three pillars of the negotiations, viz.: the opening of markets, export subsidies and trade-distorting farm support. #NP# 3.2 The EESC considers that a balanced success must be achieved simultaneously in all three of the areas covered by the agricultural negotiations, i.e. market access, domestic subsidies and export competition. Nothing is decided until everything is decided. #NP# 3.3 The EESC believes that it is crucial that other countries make offers equivalent to those already made by the EU. More specifically, the EESC believes that this requires countries with State Trading Enterprises, those that use export credits and those that exploit food aid for commercial reasons to come forward with initiatives that are conducive to a successful outcome for the negotiations. #NP# 3.4 The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been reformed, among other things, in order to make a future WTO agreement possible. The EESC believes that all aspects of these reforms must be maintained. Some Member States have raised the issue of taking an even more radical approach to the CAP, returning it to the national level or simply scrapping it altogether. WTO negotiations and developing countries needs are often taken as a pretext for this approach. The Committee does not believe that this is compatible with the EU's single market. Furthermore, the reforms have not been fully implemented and it is not yet possible to assess their impact. Thus, in this regard, the results of the Doha Round cannot go beyond those obtained from the implementation of the CAP reforms. #NP# 3.5 Another crucial question is how the negotiations should tackle issues that are not directly related to trade: multifunctionality, animal protection, food quality and food safety. The agricultural agreement requires that these non-trade concerns be taken into consideration, but how this should be done remains unclear. The difficulty here is how to give enough weight to these important issues, and also for example phytosanitary and other issues, without applying a protectionist approach in order to create obstacles to competition. However, if the aim is to secure popular legitimacy and acceptance for the WTO and the agricultural agreement, these issues must be given serious consideration in free trade negotiations, both now and in the future. #NP# 3.6 In this connection, the fact that the various market players are promoting their own programmes and standards cannot be disregarded. For example, at a conference attended by participants from almost every continent, the European retailer organisation EUREPGAP decided to broaden its standard on good agricultural practices. Although the standard is set, in part, at a low level and below the legal requirements of some countries, the EESC believes that it shows that market players both need and want to follow the global trend that calls for consumers to be able to feel more confident of traded products. #NP# 3.7 Since May 2005 there has also been, for the first time, an internationally recognised standard under the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), which could be a first step towards international rules under the WTO. #NP# 4. Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) #NP# 4.1 The EU belongs to those countries which have the lowest industrial tariffs. Moreover, imports from many countries enter EU markets on the basis of bilateral or other agreements or unilateral commitments which give some countries preferential treatment or an advantageous position under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and the ""Everything But Arms"" initiative. The EESC has previously expressed its support for further multilaterally agreed reductions, especially for environmental products and products of particular interest to developing countries. #NP# 4.2 Lower tariffs could give poor developing countries and LDCs increased access to developed countries' markets and perhaps more importantly boost South-South trade. In particular, the most advanced developing countries should undertake to open up their markets more. The EESC takes the view that countries like Argentina, Brazil and India have reached a significant level of economic development. They should participate in the negotiations by tabling offers that are commensurate with their level of economic development and should not really be guaranteed the same flexibility that is normally accorded to developing countries. Under the July Package, the Least Developed Countries are not required to lower their tariffs. #NP# 4.3 The EESC believes that it is important that the negotiations cover all bound tariffs, as is the case in the agricultural negotiations, so as to increase transparency and certainty in trade and business. Unbound tariffs would put developing countries and LDCs which have bound their tariffs at a disadvantage. #NP# 4.4 The EESC feels that non-trade barriers, such as technical standards, administrative rules and uncoordinated procedures, must be clearly identified and reduced where possible. Agreement on reducing technical barriers to trade must be sought as part of the efforts to develop common rules on labelling and certification. Harmonisation of existing international standards should, to a greater extent, take place within the framework of the WTO negotiations. #NP# 4.5 The GATT agreement and the WTO Rules allow the adoption of trade barriers if the aim is to protect the health of humans, animals or plants or to preserve non-renewable natural resources, provided these measures are accompanied by restrictions on national production or consumption. For example, in the event of a possible conflict between the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement and the GATT, the former takes precedence. The EESC feels that this protection must be fully respected in any future agreement as well. #NP# 4.6 The EESC endorses the Commission's proposal for a simple ""Swiss"" formula, with the same coefficient for all the developed countries and different coefficients for developing countries, depending on their use of Paragraph 8 flexibilities (e.g. less use of such flexibilities would result in a higher coefficient and consequently smaller formula cuts). It is important that the WTO member states reach agreement on the structure, which should be in the form of tariff cuts and on other key elements of the NAMA package in the remaining weeks before the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting. #NP# 4.7 The EESC supports the Negotiation Group's agreement that the NAMA negotiations should encompass all products not covered by Annex 1 of the Agreement on Agriculture. The EESC further endorses active EU involvement in NAMA sectoral tariff component negotiations based on the critical mass approach. The EESC notes that other important issues such as conversion of ad valorem equivalents and treatment of unbound tariff lines will have to be dealt with in a speedy manner by December. #NP# 4.8 As very little progress has been made in the negotiations to date, it would be unrealistic to expect a result to be achieved at the Hong Kong meeting in December 2005. #NP# 5. Services #NP# 5.1 The GATS services agreement provides the greatest potential here, as it is in this area of negotiation that least progress has been made. The Member States have proposed too few and inadequate measures. This is an especially important area for the EU. Service provision in rich countries accounts for some 65 % of total output, but even for the poorest countries service provision is relatively high, accounting for some 40 % of total output. In contrast, international trade in services accounts for only around 20 % of world trade. #NP# 5.2 Effective services sectors are important for the growth of every economy. It is hard to imagine a country that experiences high, sustained economic growth and increased international trade volumes without modern services infrastructure in sectors such as financial services, legal and other professional services, telecoms and transport. And it should not be forgotten that services (communications, distribution, banking, etc.) are also an essential input in the production of goods. #NP# 5.3 The EESC regrets the poor quality of initial and revised offers that do not create additional liberalisation in the services sectors. Larger developing economies (e.g. South Africa, Brazil, Venezuela) and some developed countries (e.g. USA) must go beyond existing levels of market access to provide new trade, investment and employment opportunities for global service suppliers. The constructive role of India in services negotiations should be mentioned as an encouraging example. #NP# 5.4 The EESC supports taking into account the stage of development of poor developing countries, with few demands being made on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). However, it is important that the LDCs remain committed to participation in the services negotiations, primarily for their own economic benefit. #NP# 5.5 In its opinion on GATS mode 4, the EESC endorses the facilitation of temporary service provision proposed by the EU. The EESC underlines the importance of taking measures to enforce the protection of temporary workers and to guarantee non-discrimination and the introduction of proper surveillance mechanisms. The EESC is in principle favourable to the proposal made by the European Service Forum to create a GATS Permit. This would make the movement of service providers both from and to the EU smoother and also make monitoring of the use of Mode 4 more transparent. The EESC also urges the EU not to accept any widening of Mode 4 to semi-skilled or unskilled workers for the time being. #NP# 5.6 The EESC recalls the need to maintain countries' ability to regulate public services in the pursuit of social and developmental goals, and supports the exemption from the services negotiations of public services such as education, water, health, and energy. #NP# 5.7 The EESC notes that the services negotiations, which have been based on the request-offer approach for more than 5 years, have produced very few positive results as regards services market liberalisation. A number of negotiating parties have called into question the effectiveness of this approach. The EESC supports a search during the months leading up to Hong Kong Ministerial for complementary services negotiating methods and modalities, which would impose stricter obligations on WTO members (e.g. formulae approaches at multilateral and plurilateral level; sectoral approach, etc.). #NP# 5.8 The EESC is prepared to study the EU proposal for a ""common baseline of commitments"" on services trade and a formula-based approach. However, the proposal may affect the central principle underlying the GATS, which provides for a certain degree of flexibility with regard to the choice and extent of liberalisation commitments. Moreover, some developing countries have voiced their opposition to the proposal. #NP# 5.9 The EESC supports the linking of expanded access through Mode 4 with the removal of restrictions on foreign ownership of services companies under Mode 3 (e.g. commercial presence) ‚Äî this ""trade-off"" approach is likely to persuade several developing countries to engage in services negotiations. #NP# 6. Trade Facilitation #NP# 6.1 Trade facilitation, the only ""survivor"" of the Singapore Issues, is crucial for the economic growth of any country, but particularly for poor and least developed countries that could reduce levels of poverty through greater participation in international trade. Modernised and simplified export/import, international payment, transport, logistics and customs procedures and an enhanced use of information technology and improved access to distribution channels could greatly reduce the cost of transferring goods from producers to consumers, increase international trade flows and bring new investment to developing countries. The EESC has on several occasions expressed its support for multilaterally agreed rules to address these issues. #NP# 6.2 Modernising customs and transport procedures and infrastructures can be very expensive for poor countries. Therefore technical assistance and support for capacity building is needed from the side of the developed countries. However, the beneficiary countries must take the necessary preventive measures to ensure that the resources they are allocated are used in a transparent and effective way. While the LDCs are generally exempt from trade facilitation requirements, the EESC notes that faster modernisation of trade procedures would serve their interests more than a slow and gradual undertaking of commitments. #NP# 6.3 During the following weeks prior to the Ministerial meeting, more than 30 proposals by different WTO members for trade facilitation measures and the required technical assistance will be assessed by the Negotiation Group on Trade Facilitation. The EESC hopes that developing countries will eventually benefit from the trade facilitation provisions and the scope of commitments will be linked to their capacity to implement. #NP# 7. Special and Differential Treatment #NP# 7.1 It is quite clear that the main gains for development should come from better access to industrial goods, services and agricultural markets, simpler customs procedures, clearer SPS standards, stronger WTO rules, etc. To illustrate this, the World Bank estimates that a feasible outcome of the Doha negotiations could boost global income by USD 100 billion a year, a part of which would flow to poor and developing countries. #NP# 7.2 The EESC calls on the EC to ensure that the following aspects are given priority in the negotiations leading up to the Hong Kong Ministerial and afterwards: #NP# - real progress in implementing the proposals on strengthening special and differential treatment for the weakest developing countries and LDCs, with an exemption for LDCs from any requirement to open their markets and the possibility for these countries to continue to protect products that are important to their food security and rural development with high tariffs; #NP# - greater clarification of developing countries' situations and categories by making a clearer distinction between countries which lag behind persistently and countries which already enjoy the benefits of an emerging economy; #NP# - effective support, in the form of financing and projects, for technical assistance and capacity building in the least developed countries; #NP# - serious consideration of the problem of tariff preference erosion for poor countries, including potential financial compensation; #NP# - implementation of the decisions to eliminate trade-distorting subsidies in key commodity products such as cotton and sugar; #NP# - implementation of the Decision of 30 August 2003 on paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health to find a solution to the difficulties of WTO members with no pharmaceutical production capacity to make effective use of the provision of the TRIPS Agreement authorising compulsory licensing in cases of national emergency to combat major epidemics. #NP# 7.3 Other industrial countries should offer quota-free and tariff-free market access for goods from the Least Developed Countries, as the EU has done under the ""Everything But Arms"" initiative. So far, the USA, Japan, Canada have not responded to this initiative, despite the promises made at the 2001 Millennium Conference. #NP# 7.4 Opening markets to products from the poorest countries must be complemented by huge financial resources for capacity building assistance and infrastructure development to help these countries produce and transport goods to world markets. The EESC strongly welcomes the EU commitment at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles to raise the level of its trade-related development assistance to EUR 1bn a year. The US, and international financial institutions like the World Bank and the IMF, should follow the European lead and allocate more resources for trade capacity development needs. #NP# 8. Anti-Dumping Rules #NP# 8.1 The number of anti-dumping cases has increased dramatically since the Uruguay Round in many developing and emerging countries. As tariffs have largely been reduced, dumping rules are increasingly used for protectionist purposes, as illustrated by some of the anti-dumping cases in the USA and elsewhere. Methodological biases and anti-dumping investigation practices (e.g. estimate of damage) are often abused to prevent foreign companies from entering markets. This usually serves the interests of a few selected firms at the expense of wider public interest. #NP# 8.2 The EESC supports revision of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement provisions to restrict the use of anti-dumping measures for protectionist and political reasons. Some of the proposed measures, such as prohibition of chain complaints, the ""lesser duty rule"", the public interest test, limitation of investigation periods and the duration of anti-dumping measures, would render it more difficult to use anti-dumping rules for protectionist causes. #NP# 8.3 The EESC concurs with the Commission's critical assessment of the progress made in negotiations on anti-dumping rules. With little time left before the Hong Kong Ministerial, there should at least be a general agreement on those issues where Ministers should agree to launch legal text-based negotiations. #NP# 9. Social Issues #NP# 9.1 It is worth noting that paragraph 8 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration states: ""We reaffirm our declaration at the Singapore Ministerial Conference regarding internationally recognised core labour standards. We take note of the work under way in the International Labour Organization (ILO) on the social dimension of globalisation."" #NP# 9.2 The EESC considers it important to incorporate the ILO core labour standards into the international trading system. Even if these matters remain outside the scope of the Doha Agenda negotiations, the Committee supports the ILO initiatives in this field and supports the ILO being granted the status of permanent observer to the WTO. It will be difficult to achieve popular legitimacy for a world trade system where workers lose their jobs because of companies where people work in inhuman conditions and there are no union rights of any kind. It is therefore important to embed the eight Fundamental ILO Conventions in the WTO international trade system. The need for flanking measures to protect social rights is particularly relevant to the GATS Agreement, which regulates the freedom of natural persons to temporarily provide services across borders (Mode 4). #NP# 9.3 The EESC welcomes the recommendations by the EC on implementation of the report by the ILO World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation. The EESC endorses the EC strategy of introducing core labour standards into the international trade and investment system by incorporating them into bilateral and regional trade agreements. The EESC also calls for a social chapter to be included in the ongoing EU-Mercosur negotiations. #NP# 9.4 The EESC emphasises that the EC should stick to its policy of establishing an institutionalised standing forum bringing together the WTO, ILO, UNCTAD, World Bank, IMF and other international players with the objective of fostering international policy coherence. #NP# 10. Environmental concerns #NP# 10.1 The word ""environment"" was not even mentioned in the old GATT agreement. Although the WTO's remit is limited to trade, environmental concerns are now one of the objectives of the WTO agreement. The Doha Declaration gave a mandate for negotiations in the field of environment and trade with the aim of clarifying any discrepancies between trade-related obligations in international environmental conventions and WTO rules. #NP# 10.2 The EESC believes that the Committee on Trade and Environment should continue negotiations on the issue of the relationship between WTO rules and multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), despite the discouraging progress made so far. The EESC also calls for the MEA secretariats and the UNEP to be given observer status at the WTO. #NP# 10.3 The EESC believes that barriers to trade in environmental goods (e.g. related to sanitation, wastewater management and renewable energy) and services should be lifted as soon as possible. The EESC hopes that a list of environmental goods and services will be finalised in time for the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference. #NP# 11. WTO and Civil Society #NP# 11.1 The EESC invites the various civil society players (businessmen, socio-occupational organisations, social partners, NGOs) to take steps to: #NP# - participate in information campaigns about the issues at stake in the Doha Agenda; #NP# - organise international meetings, at a cross-sectoral level or within sectors of activity; #NP# - contribute through their assessments, proposals and participation to the success of sustainable development worldwide. #NP# 11.2 In addition to institutionalised dialogue between the WTO and civil society, urgent consideration should also be given to how civil society and the other social partners could, under the terms of UN category 1 and 2, which regulate the involvement of NGOs and the social partners, be given greater involvement in the dispute settlement procedure. #NP# 11.3 The Committee will take part in these initiatives. Before the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, the EESC will, as in 2004, organise a conference to discuss proposals for improving participatory democracy by involving organised civil society in WTO activities. #NP# 11.4 The EESC intends to strengthen dialogue on international trade with representatives of other economic and social councils both from EU Member States and from third countries, e.g. the ACP countries, the least developed countries and regional trading blocs in the Americas (such as Mercosur and the Andean Community), Asia (ASEAN, SAARC) and Africa (ECOWAS and SADC), as well as with other developing countries. #NP# 11.5 The 2003 opinion ""For a WTO with a human face"" also contains specific proposals to promote greater involvement of developing countries and civil society in WTO activities. The EESC opinion proposes establishing a parliamentary dimension to the WTO, setting up a formal dialogue between the WTO and the stakeholders of organised civil society, providing ongoing support to the least developed countries by transferring resources and technical expertise, and establishing a formal dialogue between the WTO and other international organisations (UN, World Bank, IMF, OECD, ILO, etc.). #NP# 11.6 The EESC feels that before a new trade agreement takes effect there is a need to carry out thorough impact assessments with regard to food security, employment, social standards and gender equality, particularly for the developing countries. Accordingly, the EESC welcomes the Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) studies undertaken by the Commission, which already provide guidance as to what needs to be done so that the trade round really does achieve the desired results. The EESC also requests that civil society players be consulted regarding the implementation of such studies. #S# Brussels, 27 October 2005. #NP# The President #NP# of the European Economic and Social Committee #NP# Anne-Marie Sigmund #NP# [1] The preparation of the 4th WTO Ministerial Conference: ESC position, rapporteur: Mr Vever, co-rapporteur: Ms S√°nchez OJ C 36, 8.2.2002, p. 99). #NP# [2] Preparation of the 5th WTO Ministerial Conference, rapporteur: Mr Vever (OJ C 234, 30.9.2003, p. 95). #NP# [3] The Social Dimension of Globalisation ‚Äì the EU's policy contribution on extending the benefits to all, rapporteurs: Mr Etty and Ms Hornung-Draus (OJ C 234, 30.9.2005, p. 41). #NP# [4] COM(2004) 383 final. #NP# [5] General agreement on trade in services (GATS) ‚Äì Mode 4 negotiations (temporary movement of physical persons), rapporteur: Ms Florio. #NP# -------------------------------------------------- #S# ",5765;5525,76;08,7621;0806,2188;3474,2188;5765;3650;5525;3474,train

Specification #NP# (summary of requirements under Article 4(2)): #NP# Name : ""Chouri√ßo de Ab√≥bora de Barroso ‚Äî Montalegre"" #NP# Description : A smoked sausage, made from the pig meat and pig fat of the Bisaro breed or of cross-breeds that must be 50 % Bisaro, and drained squash, made into a soft and dry paste in which small pieces of meat shreds are visible, stuffed into a hog casing (large intestine). The pig meat and fat are seasoned with salt, garlic, red or white wine, powdered chilli pepper (regionally known as ""pimento"") and powdered red bell pepper (or ""piment√£o""). The sausage varies in colour from orange to dark brown. It has a cylindrical section approximately 6 cm in diameter and a rough exterior. The hog casing is tied shut with two simple knots at each end, using a single piece of cotton twine, giving the sausage a horseshoe shape. #NP# Geographical area : Due to the special production requirements of these sausages, their flavours, the expertise available and the climatic conditions of the region, the geographical area for processing and packing is limited to the municipality of Montalegre in the Vila Real district. Taking into account the traditional animal feed and existing agricultural production, the geographical area for processing and packing is naturally limited to the municipalities of Boticas, Chaves and Montalegre, in the Vila Real district. The territory consisting of these three municipalities is known and identified as ""Barroso"". #NP# Proof of origin : The farms, slaughterhouses and meat-cutting and preparation plants must be licensed, authorised by the group of producers after the private control body has given its approval, and located in the specified production or processing areas respectively. The entire production process, from the farm that produces the raw materials to the place where the product is sold, is subject to a rigorous control system ensuring the product is fully traceable. The pigs are reared in livestock farms possessing an area compatible with traditional, semi-extensive farming systems, where it is possible to produce traditional animal feed. The certification mark on each sausage is numbered, ensuring full traceability to the farm where the product originated. It is possible to prove the origin of the product at any point in the production chain by means of the serial number, which must be indicated on the certification mark. #NP# Method of production : Fatty cuts of meat (flank, topside trimmings and cured ham, and occasionally lung), cut into small pieces, are used. The squash are cut in half, cleaned and the flesh scraped out with a spoon, after which it is wrapped in a cloth for two days to drain off the excess liquid. The pig meat is seasoned with salt, red or white wine from the Tr√°s-os-Montes region, and garlic. It is marinated for up to 5 days at a temperature below 10 ¬∞C in a room with low humidity, after which chilli pepper powder and red bell pepper powder are added. Enough squash is then added to make up approximately 20 % of the mixture. This mixture is then stuffed into a hog casing (large intestine). After filling has been stuffed into the hog casing and the ends have been knotted with cotton twine, the casing is cut to the desired size. The two ends are then tied together with simple knots, bending the sausage into a horseshoe shape. The sausage is smoked over a low fire in a smoking room or a traditional smokehouse for approximately 30 days. The smoke is obtained through the direct combustion of wood, primarily oak, from the region. The sausage is placed on the market as a whole sausage and is always pre-packed at the place of origin. Due to the product's characteristics and composition, it cannot be cut or sliced. Special material, which is innocuous and inert when it comes into contact with the product, is used for its packaging. The product may be packed in a normal or controlled atmosphere or in a vacuum. Packing can only be carried out in the geographical processing area so as to ensure traceability and control and to prevent any change to the product's taste and microbiological characteristics. #NP# Link : Due to climatic, geographic and socio‚Äìeconomic conditions, and the diff√≠culty of communicating with the rest of the country, the diet of the Barroso region was limited to local products, mainly bread, potatoes and pork. References made to taxes on pigs and pork products in various municipal registers, including that of Montalegre, prove that pig-breeding has been important in this area for a very long time. For pork to remain edible throughout the year, ways were discovered to preserve it, and these quickly became ancestral skills passed down from one generation to the next. The preparation of these products is the result of, and is very dependent on, the region's cold and dry climate, which forces every household to keep a fire burning at all times, thus providing unique conditions for smoking, characterised by a light and gradual smoke supply. It was thus that the need to take advantage of and preserve the pig meat provided by the traditional slaughter gave rise to sausages of various shapes, different ingredients and different colours and flavours, but which were always an expression of the local characteristics: the land and its people. In short, the relationship between this product and the geographical area stems from the breed of (indigenous) animal, the local produce fed to these animals, the knowledge to choose the correct pieces of pig meat, the smoking process using regional firewood and the curing process conducted in a very cold and dry environment suitable for preserving the product. #NP# Name: | Tradi√ß√£o e Qualidade ‚Äî Associa√ß√£o Interprofissional para Produtos Agro-Alimentares de Tr√°s-os-Montes | #NP# Address: | Av. 25 de Abril, 273 S/L P-5370 Mirandela | #NP# Tel.: | (351-278) 261 410 | #NP# Fax: | (351-278) 261 410 | #NP# Email: | tradicao-qualidade@clix.pt | #NP# Inspection body : #NP# Tradi√ß√£o e Qualidade has been recognised as complying with the requirements of Standard 45011:2001. #NP# +++++ TIFF +++++ #NP# Labelling : #NP# It is compulsory for the labelling to include the following: the wording ""Chouri√ßa de ab√≥bora de Barroso ‚Äî Montalegre ‚Äî Indica√ß√£o Geogr√°fica Protegida"" (Protected Geographical Indication), the Community's own logo, the logo for Barroso-Montalegre, reproduced below, together with the words ""Montalegre"" and ""Chouri√ßa de ab√≥bora"".

101,32005R0673,en,2005,"Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 #NP# of 25 April 2005 #NP# establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America #NP# THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, #NP# Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, #NP# Whereas: #NP# (1) On 27 January 2003, the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) adopted the Appellate Body report [1] and the Panel report [2], as upheld by the Appellate Body report, finding that the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) was incompatible with the United States' obligations under the WTO agreements. #NP# (2) Since the United States failed to bring its legislation in conformity with the covered agreements, the Community requested to the DSB the authorisation to suspend the application of its tariff concessions and related obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 to the United States [3]. The United States objected to the level of suspension of tariff concessions and related obligations and the matter was referred to arbitration. #NP# (3) On 31 August 2004, the Arbitrator determined that the level of nullification or impairment caused every year to the Community was equal to 72 % of the amount of CDSOA disbursements relating to anti-dumping or countervailing duties paid on imports from the Community for the most recent year for which data are available at that time, as published by the United States' authorities. The Arbitrator concluded that the suspension by the Community of concessions or other obligations, in the form of the imposition of an additional import duty above bound custom duties, on a list of products originating in the United States covering, on a yearly basis, a total value of trade not exceeding the amount of nullification or impairment would be consistent with WTO rules. On 26 November 2004, the DSB granted the authorisation to suspend the application to the United States of tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 in accordance with the decision of the Arbitrator. #NP# (4) The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data are available relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2004 ( 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004). On the basis of the data published by the United States' Customs and Border Protection, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community is calculated at USD 27,81 million. The Community may, therefore, suspend the application of its tariff concessions to the United States at an equivalent amount. The effect of a 15 % ad valorem additional import duty on imports of the products in Annex I originating in the United States represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed USD 27,81 million. In respect of these products, the Community should suspend the application of its tariff concessions to the United States from 1 May 2005. #NP# (5) If the non-implementation of the DSB ruling and recommendation persists, the Commission should adjust annually the level of suspension to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Community at that time. The Commission should amend the list in Annex I or the rate of the additional import duty so that the effect of the additional duty on imports from the United States of the selected products represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed the amount of nullification or impairment. #NP# (6) The Commission should respect the following criteria: #NP# (a) The Commission should amend the rate of the additional import duty when adding or removing products from the list in Annex I does not allow to adjust the level of suspension to the level of nullification or impairment. Otherwise, the Commission should add products to the list in Annex I if the level of suspension increases or withdraw products from this list if the level of suspension decreases. #NP# (b) If products are added, the Commission should select the products from the list in Annex II in an automatic fashion by following the order in which the products are listed. As a consequence, the Commission should also amend the list in Annex II by removing from it the products added to the list in Annex I. #NP# (c) If products are withdrawn, the Commission should, first, remove products that were added to the list in Annex I at a later stage. The Commission should then remove products presently in the list in Annex I by following the order of that list. #NP# (7) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [4]. #NP# (8) To avoid circumvention of the additional duty, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication, #NP# HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: #NP# Article 1 #NP# The tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 of the Community are hereby suspended in respect of products originating in the United States of America listed in Annex I to this Regulation. #NP# Article 2 #NP# An ad valorem duty of 15 % additional to the customs duty applicable under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code [5] shall be imposed on the products originating in the United States of America listed in Annex I to this Regulation. #NP# Article 3 #NP# 1. The Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the United States' Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) to the Community at that time.

These products shall be selected from the list in Annex II following the order of that list; #NP# (d) Except in circumstances set out in point (e), when the level of suspension decreases, products shall be withdrawn from the list in Annex I. The Commission shall remove, first, products that are presently in the list in Annex II and were added to the list in Annex I at a later stage. The Commission shall then remove products that are presently in the list in Annex I following the order of that list; #NP# (e) The Commission shall amend the rate of the additional duty when the level of suspension cannot be adjusted to the level of nullification or impairment by adding or removing products from the list in Annex I. #NP# 2. When products are added to the list in Annex I, the Commission shall, at the same time, amend the list in Annex II by removing those products from the list in Annex II.

32,32005R0559,en,2005,"Commission Regulation (EC) No 559/2005 #NP# of 12 April 2005 #NP# on initiating an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2074/2004 on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People‚Äôs Republic of China by imports of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic, whether declared as originating in Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic or not and making such imports subject to registration #NP# THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, #NP# Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 13(3), 14(3) and 14(5) thereof, #NP# After having consulted the Advisory Committee, #NP# Whereas: #NP# A. REQUEST #NP# (1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People‚Äôs Republic of China. #NP# (2) The request has been lodged on 28 February 2005 by Ring Alliance Ringbuchtechnik GmbH on behalf of producers representing more than 70 % of the Community production of certain ring binder mechanisms. #NP# B. PRODUCT #NP# (3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is certain ring binder mechanisms normally declared under CN code ex83051000 originating in the People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC). This CN code is given only for information. #NP# (4) The product under investigation is certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic (product under investigation) normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned originating in the People‚Äôs Republic of China. #NP# C. EXISTING MEASURES #NP# (5) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2074/2004 [2] as extended to imports of the same product consigned from Vietnam [3]. #NP# D. GROUNDS #NP# (6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence, that the anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in the People‚Äôs Republic of China are being circumvented by means of transhipment via Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic and/or by assembly in Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic of the product under investigation. The evidence submitted is as follows: #NP# - The request shows a significant change in the pattern of trade, as imports of the product under investigation have increased substantially, whereas imports of the product concerned originating in the People‚Äôs Republic of China have decreased following the imposition of measures, and that there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change. #NP# - This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from a transhipment of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China via Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic and/or the assembly of certain ring binder mechanisms in Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic. #NP# - Furthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in the People‚Äôs Republic of China are being undermined in terms of quantity and prices. Significant volumes of imports of certain ring binder mechanisms from Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned originating in the People‚Äôs Republic of China. #NP# - Finally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of the product under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People‚Äôs Republic of China. #NP# - Should circumvention practices via Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation, other than transhipment and assembly, be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may cover these practices also. #NP# E. PROCEDURE #NP# (7) In light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic, whether declared as originating in Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the Basic Regulation. #NP# (a) Questionnaires #NP# (8) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic, to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in the People‚Äôs Republic of China, to the importers and to the associations of importers in the Community which cooperated in the investigation that lead to the existing measures or which are listed in the request and to the authorities of the People‚Äôs Republic of China and Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry. #NP# (9) In any event all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and, if necessary, request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties. #NP# (10) The authorities of the People‚Äôs Republic of China and Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request. #NP# (b) Collection of information and holding of hearings #NP# (11) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. #NP# (c) Exemption of registration of imports or measures #NP# (12) Since the possible circumvention takes place outside the Community, exemptions may be granted, in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, to producers of the product concerned that can show that they are not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the basic Regulation. Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation. #NP# F. REGISTRATION #NP# (13) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic. #NP# G. TIME LIMITS #NP# (14) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which: #NP# - interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation, #NP# - producers in Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic may request exemption from registration of imports or measures, #NP# - interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. #NP# (15) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party‚Äôs making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation. #NP# H. NON-COOPERATION #NP# (16) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or otherwise does not provide necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available. #NP# (17) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of facts available. If any interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to the party than if it had cooperated, #NP# HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: #NP# Article 1 #NP# An investigation is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, in order to determine if imports into the Community of certain ring binder mechanisms, falling within CN code ex83051000 (TARIC code 8305100013 and 8305100023), consigned from Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic, whether declared as originating in Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic or not, are circumventing the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 2074/2004. #NP# For the purpose of this Regulation, ring binder mechanisms shall consist of two rectangular steel sheets or wires with at least four half rings made of steel wire fixed on it and which are kept together by a steel cover. They can be opened either by pulling the half rings or with a small steel-made trigger mechanism fixed to the ring binder mechanism. #NP# Article 2 #NP# The Customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Community identified in Article 1 of this Regulation. #NP# Registration shall expire nine months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation. #NP# The Commission, by regulation, may direct Customs authorities to cease registration in respect of imports into the Community of products manufactured by producers having applied for an exemption of registration and having been found not to be circumventing the anti-dumping duties. #NP# Article 3 #NP# 1. Questionnaires should be requested from the Commission within 15 days from publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# 2. If their representations are to be taken into account during the investigation, interested parties must make themselves known by contacting the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information within 40 days from the date of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union, unless otherwise specified. #NP# 3. Producers in Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic requesting exemption from registration of imports or measures should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the same 40-day time limit. #NP# 4. Interested parties may also apply to be heard by the Commission within the same 40-day time limit. #NP# 5. Any information relating to the matter, any request for a hearing or for a questionnaire as well as any request for exemption must be made in writing (not in electronic format, unless otherwise specified), must indicate the name, address, e-mail address, telephone, fax and/or telex numbers of the interested party. All written submission, including the information requested in this Regulation, questionnaire replies and correspondence provided by interested parties on a confidential basis shall be labelled as ""Limited"" [4] and, in accordance with Article 19(2) of the basic Regulation, shall be accompanied by a non-confidential version, which will be labelled ""For inspection by interested parties"" and should be sent to the following address: #NP# European Commission #NP# Directorate-General for Trade #NP# Directorate B #NP# J-79 5/16 #NP# B-1049 Brussels #NP# Fax (32-2) 295 65 05. #NP# Article 4 #NP# This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. #NP# This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. #S# Done at Brussels, 12 April 2005. #NP# For the Commission #NP# Peter Mandelson #NP# Member of the Commission #NP# [1] OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.

41,52005PC0584,en,2005,"[pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | #NP# Brussels, 23.11.2005 #NP# COM(2005) 584 final #NP# Proposal for a #NP# COUNCIL DECISION #NP# on the signature, on behalf of the European Community, and the provisional application of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters concerning the amendments to the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement on cooperation in the sea fisheries sector between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the period 1 August 2001 to 31 July 2006 #NP# (presented by the Commission) #NP# EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM #NP# The purpose of this proposal is to amend the existing Protocol to the Agreement on cooperation in the sea fisheries sector between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. #NP# On the basis of the conclusions of the technical working group comprising representatives of the Mauritanian administration and the European Commission, which held technical meetings from 30 June to 2 July and on 14 and 15 July in Nouakchott and from 7 to 10 September 2004 in Brussels, and in the light of the scientific opinions available, the two parties reached the conclusion at the Joint Committee meeting held on 10 September 2004 in Brussels that a number of measures should be taken concerning the management of the fishing effort in Mauritania's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). #NP# The Agreement on the amendments to the existing Protocol has been formalised by an Exchange of Letters. #NP# The measures in question are aimed, on the one hand, at reducing the catch rate for cephalopods by decreasing the fishing effort and, on the other, by increasing the number of licences in the pelagic and tuna categories. In order to help integrate fleets flying the flags of the new Member States and guarantee continued access for Community fishing vessels traditionally operating under the above-mentioned Agreement, licences for the pelagic category will be awarded on the basis of the licence applications received from all Member States, taking into account the fishing activities traditionally carried on under this Agreement. If need be, the Commission will make a proposal on the allocation of licences for the pelagic category among the Member States. #NP# The suspension of five cephalopod licences, which was the subject of a consultation with the Member States as far back as March 2004, has now been compensated for under this reorganisation through the issue of these new pelagic licences, thus guaranteeing sound and healthy financial management by allowing fishing opportunities to be adjusted in accordance with resources and sectoral demands. The new balance achieved through this reorganisation was established on the basis of the results of the 2001 negotiations on the existing Protocol and constitutes a very satisfactory outcome for the EC in cost-benefit terms. #NP# On this basis, the Commission proposes that the Council adopt by Decision the provisional application of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters pending its definitive entry into force. #NP# A proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters on the amendments to the Protocol is the subject of a separate procedure. #NP# Proposal for a #NP# COUNCIL DECISION #NP# on the signature, on behalf of the European Community, and the provisional application of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters concerning the amendments to the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement on cooperation in the sea fisheries sector between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the period 1 August 2001 to 31 July 2006 #NP# THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, #NP# Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 37 in conjunction with Article 300(2) thereof, #NP# Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], #NP# Whereas: #NP# (1) The Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement on cooperation in the sea fisheries sector between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania came into effect on 1 August 2001 and is valid until 31 July 2006[2]. #NP# (2) In view of the scientific opinions on the state of resources in the Mauritanian EEZ and, in particular, the results of the fourth and fifth working groups of the Mauritanian Institute of Oceanographic Research and Fisheries (IMROP) and of the joint scientific working group, and in the light of the conclusions drawn from those results at the meeting of the Joint Committee held on 10 September and 15 and 16 December 2004, the two parties have decided to amend the existing fishing opportunities. #NP# (3) The outcome of those amendments has been the subject of an Exchange of Letters and involves a temporary reduction in the fishing effort for cephalopods (category 5), the fixing of a second closed period of one month for demersal fishing, and an increase in the number of pole-and-line tuna vessels and surface longliners (category 8) and pelagic freezer trawlers (category 9). #NP# (4) So that those amendments to fishing opportunities can apply as soon as possible, the Agreement should, therefore, be signed in the form of an Exchange of Letters, subject to its definitive conclusion by the Council. #NP# (5) The allocation of the new fishing opportunities among the Member States, as thus amended, should be confirmed, #NP# HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: #NP# Article 1 #NP# The signature of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters amending the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement on cooperation in the sea fisheries sector between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the period 1 August 2001 to 31 July 2006 is hereby approved by the Council on behalf of the Community. #NP# The text of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters is attached to this Decision. #NP# Article 2 #NP# The President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the persons empowered to sign the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters on behalf of the Community subject to its conclusion. #NP# Article 3 #NP# The Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters shall be applied on a provisional basis by the Community as from 1 January 2005. #NP# Article 4 #NP# Following the amendments set out in the Exchange of Letters, the new fishing opportunities for the ""pole-and-line tuna vessel and surface longliner"" category (Datasheet No 8 of the Protocol) and for the ""pelagic freezer trawler"" category (Datasheet No 9) shall be allocated among the Member States as follows: #NP# Fishing category | Member State | Tonnage/Number of vessels which may be used | #NP# Pole-and-line tuna vessels Surface longliners (vessels) | Spain Portugal France | 20 + 3= 23 3 + 0= 3 8 + 1= 9 | #NP# Pelagic species (vessels) | 15+10= 25 | #NP# The temporary suspension of five (5) fishing licences for the cephalopod fishing category shall take effect as from 1 January 2005. The future reactivation of those five (5) licences shall be decided by common accord in a Joint Committee meeting held between the Commission and the Mauritanian authorities on the basis of the state of resources. #NP# If licence applications from Member States do not cover all the fishing opportunities laid down by the Protocol, the Commission may take into consideration licence applications from any other Member State. #S# Done at Brussels, #NP# For the Council #NP# The President #NP# AGREEMENT IN THE FORM OF AN EXCHANGE OF LETTERS #NP# concerning the provisional application of the Protocol amending the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement on cooperation in the sea fisheries sector between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the period 1 August 2001 to 31 July 2006 #NP# A.

Specification #NP# (summary of requirements under Article 4(2)) #NP# Name : ""Cl√©mentine de Corse"" #NP# Description - a reddish-orange colour with up to 1/5 of the surface area of the peel green, #NP# - medium-sized to small, with a maximum cross-section diameter of between 46 and 68 mm, #NP# - a minimum juice content of 42 %, #NP# - a tart taste, #NP# - an internal ripeness defined by the proportion (E/A) of sugar content of its juice (E), expressed in Brix concentration, to the acidity of the same juice (A) expressed in grams of citric acid per 100 g. The proportion E/A should be between 8 and 17, where the acidity level is between 0.65 and 1.4, #NP# - at least 30 % of the fruit marketed with one or two leaves attached to the stalk. #NP# Geographical area : #NP# The Cl√©mentine de Corse's geographical production area covers the territory or part of the territory of certain municipalities in the Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud Departments, which make up the island of Corsica in the Mediterranean. Most of the territory lies in coastal areas and is defined by altitude, slope and distance from the sea (see paragraph 4.6). #NP# Production, harvesting and packaging operations are all #NP# done in the PGI area. #NP# Proof of origin : #NP# Each operator is inspected in advance and authorised by the applicant group and the certification body. An initial identification of each orchard block ensures traceability, which is maintained throughout the various stages leading to the final consumer. #NP# Each holding has an orchard list identifying the clementine tree parcels and orchard blocks. A grower's notebook makes it possible to keep track of the type of work carried out by grower and by orchard block. Each consignment of fruit harvested is identified by grower and by orchard block. It keeps this identification number on delivery to the packing station, for the ""in"" and ""out"" registration and on dispatching and transporting. #NP# At the stage of sale to the final consumer, the packs are consequently identified by a number which includes the number of the packaged batch, the number of the packing station, the number of the holding and the orchard block from which the batch comes. #NP# Method of production - An ""orchard block"" is a number of clementine trees satisfying the following conditions: they comprise a single variety, are found in a homogeneous area (from the point of view of soil, exposure, altitude), managed in a uniform way, independent of other orchard blocks on the holding (times and methods of fertilising, irrigating, health protection, various treatments, pruning, harvesting etc.) #NP# - The know-how, obtained by pooling the experience of growers, the result of twenty years of local agronomic research and the development of tools to aid network decision-making make it possible to obtain a homogeneous and specific quality of fruit. #NP# - The clementine trees are pruned each year. #NP# - Fertilisation and irrigation are adjusted on the basis of regularly measured agronomic and analytic parameters. Parcels must have an irrigation system. #NP# - The fruit is harvested manually as soon as the fruit has attained its optimum colour and ripeness on the tree. There are several pickings to optimise the homogeneity of the batches harvested. The fruit is picked with its leaves to guarantee freshness. #NP# - Once the fruit has been picked, it may not be treated chemically. The use of colour enhancers is prohibited. At the packing stage the clementines are merely coated in natural wax and selected to comply with the quality standards for the ""Corsican clementine"". #NP# - Size grading and packing operations take place in the PGI area to preserve the quality of the fruit, ensure produce traceability and facilitate checks on these stages of production. The rules on sizing, adopted collectively by the operators, make it possible to achieve a strict definition of a given size class. Fruit certified under the PGI comprises only sizes 1 to 5. The final PGI approval is based on packed consignments. #NP# - The packaging guarantees the identification and quality of the fruit until it is sold to the final consumer. #NP# Link - When the clementine tree was discovered in Algeria in the 1920s, plants were frequently brought to Corsica and planted there. Thereafter, detailed technical and economic studies conducted by the San Giuliano Agricultural Research Station, set up in Corsica at the end of the 1950s, demonstrated that the clementine tree should be given pride of place in citrus-growing in this region. #NP# - From 1964, citrus growers had no hesitation in planting clementine trees extensively. Nowadays, the Corsican orchard covers more than 2000 hectares and gives an average yield of 22000 tonnes. #NP# - Today it may be said that the Cl√©mentine de Corse is clearly renowned and that the leaf attached to it is closely associated with its origin. The Corsican clementine is considered to be a specific product in terms of its qualities (size, taste, juiciness and colour). #NP# - That said, the specific qualities, while influenced by the growers, also reflect the soil and climate of the island, and its very insularity: #NP# - The citrus growing soil of the PGI area of Corsica is distinguished from the soil frequently found elsewhere in the Mediterranean by its granite and slate origins and by its often more acid and lighter character, resembling the soil found in temperate maritime climates. This soil makes it possible to develop specific rootstocks which give the fruit a special quality. #NP# - The maritime influence and neighbouring presence of mountains give the production area a special climate typified by moderate temperatures, high rainfall and atmospheric humidity, which help to produce a fruit with a specific colour and taste (more acidic, less sweet). #NP# - In addition, the fact that Corsica is an island helps to keep the clementine trees free from various serious viral diseases. The small size of the orchards, together with the mountainous terrain, is conducive to a better control over the evolution of parasites which could affect the fruit. #NP# - These are all reasons why the geographical area has been defined as where these soil and climatic conditions are to be found, together with a certain number of easily identifiable distinct criteria for indicating location, as follows: #NP# - Altitude: only areas between 2 and 300 metres are taken into consideration. Below two metres the soil is systematically unfavourable (salt, hydromorphic, peatland, too sandy). Above 300 metres the slope and climate are unfavourable. #NP# - Slope: it should be less than 25 %. #NP# - Distance from the sea: it should be less than 15 km, the limit for benefiting from the maritime climate. #NP# Name: | CERTIPAQ.

Almost 2,000 of these proposals were retained for funding (involving some 13,700 participants). #NP# In total nearly 2,100 contracts were signed in 2004 with a total EC contribution of more than 4,200 million euro. #NP# Under the heading of ‚ÄòIntegrating and Strengthening the ERA‚Äô, more than 7,300 proposals were submitted of which almost 1,100 were selected for funding involving over 11,400 participations. The majority of these (some 4,200 proposals) were in the seven thematic priorities of the 6th Framework Programme, and a significant number in the horizontal activities involving SMEs and the specific measures in support of international cooperation. #NP# The new activities in FP6 on SSP (Scientific Support to Policy) and NEST (New and Emerging Science and Technology) have also proved to be successful with over 120 proposals selected for funding. #NP# Under the heading ‚ÄòStructuring the ERA‚Äô over 8 500 proposals were received in 2004, of which the vast majority (around 7,900 proposals) under the Human Resources and Mobility actions. More than 800 proposals were selected for funding, of which 90 % were for human resources and mobility; the others were for funding actions for Research and Innovation, Research Infrastructures and Science and Society. #NP# From the proposals submitted in 2004, the new instruments integrated projects and networks of excellence accounted for some 900 proposals, of which some 150 were retained for funding. During 2004, 165 contracts for integrated projects were signed and 76 for networks of excellence. #NP# The work programmes for the Specific Programmes of the 6th Framework Programme have been updated several times. By the end of 2004 the EC 'Integrating and strengthening the ERA' programme had been updated 14 times, the EC 'Structuring the ERA' programme eight times, and the work programme for the Euratom ‚ÄòFission and Fusion' programme twice. Each update generates the content for new calls for proposals and by the end of 2004 over 120 calls for proposals had been published under FP6. #NP# A review of the effectiveness of the instruments of the 6th Framework Programme started at the end of 2003 by an independent high level panel led by Professor R. Marim√≥n. The report of the panel[4] was submitted by the end of June 2004. The panel which assessed the new instruments (networks of excellence and integrated projects) endorsed the objectives addressed by these instruments, but proposed some adjustments in their implementation. The Commission gave an official reply to the report at the end of August 2004 and continued carrying out corrective measures as well as introducing an action plan for rationalisation and acceleration to improve the implementation of the framework programme. #NP# A Five-Year Assessment for 1999-2003 was carried out by the panel of high-level experts chaired by Dr E. Ormala. The panel underlined the importance of the framework programmes in developing Europe's knowledge base and correcting the shortcomings in the European research landscape, particularly the networking of researchers and activities. The Panel‚Äôs recommendations concerned both the 6th Framework Programme and future framework programmes, in particular the endorsement of a substantial increase in funds for research and the creation of the European Research Council and technology platforms. This evaluation was supported by a series of ex-post impact studies. The impact study concerning the 5th Framework Programme concluded that it had promoted research of strategic importance which would not have taken place without EU support. #NP# Other actions towards the creation of a European Research Area #NP# In addition to the Framework Programme, the European Union took a number of other important steps towards the creation of a European Research Area, a major objective of the Research DG. #NP# The ‚ÄòInvesting in research‚Äô action plan, currently under way, has already come up with its first concrete results, such as the creation of some 25 Technology Platforms. Many of these Technology Platforms are already well advanced in developing Strategic Research Agendas. The coordination of national research policies through the so called Open Method of Coordination (OMC) involving CREST is also being implemented (see Section 3.1 below). #NP# Initiatives were carried out with a view to attracting the best researchers in Europe and improving their career prospects, such as: visas for third-country researchers‚Äô[5]; the preparation of a proposal for a recommendation for a European Researchers Charter and for a code for conduct for the recruitment of researchers; the ERA-link network linking European researchers working in the United States; and the ERA-MORE network between mobility centres for European researchers. #NP# The Communication ‚ÄôTowards a European strategy for nanotechnology‚Äô[6] triggered a political debate on this key 21st-century technology, which seeks to develop products, techniques and systems on an atomic and molecular scale which will make life easier and can be applied in numerous areas such as health, environment and security. #NP# To contribute to establishing an independent European satellite observation and remote sensing capacity, the Commission presented a plan for implementing the second phase(2004-2008) of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security initiative (GMES)[7] in close collaboration with the European Space Agency. Together with the highly strategic navigation satellite project GALILEO, this initiative will form an integral part of the European space programme which is in preparation. #NP# The Group on Earth Observations (GEO), which seeks to develop by February 2005 a 10-year implementation plan for a comprehensive, coordinated and sustained Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), is co-chaired by the European Commission, United States, Japan and South Africa. Of the 55 GEO member countries, 20 % are from Europe. The Commission closely supports the preparation of the GEOSS implementation plan and coordinates the European position. #NP# The European Union worked to secure a consensus between the parties on the geographical location of the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project at the Cadarache (France) site, chosen unanimously by the Council, and on the complementary activities to ITER. The ITER project is aimed at constructing a nuclear fusion reactor in partnership between the European Union, Japan, the United States, China, South Korea and Russia. Demonstrating the viability of such a non-polluting energy source would be an essential step towards meeting growing energy needs. #NP# The new preparatory action on security research[8] seeks to foster the development of a strategic research agenda to plug the gap between civil research supported by the Community framework programmes and national and intergovernmental initiatives. #NP# The signing of Scientific and Technological Agreements with Brazil and Mexico, and ratification of agreements with Tunisia and Morocco in 2004 furthered the international dimension of the European Research Area. #NP# The Communication entitled ""Europe and basic research""[9] was presented in early 2004, identifying the need for a new support mechanism for basic research based solely on criteria of scientific excellence, i.e. through a European Research Council. The debate on this Communication also contributed to the preparation of the proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme. #NP# Developments in Member States and application of the Open Method of Coordination #NP# The Open Method of Coordination in support of reaching the Barcelona objectives #NP# The Open Method of Coordination (OMC) is a Community response to contribute to policy learning and policy integration by encouraging and facilitating mutual exchange of knowledge and best practice. In 2004 a first cycle of application of the OMC to research policy was concluded successfully. The CREST report on this first cycle of the implementation of the OMC to the 3% Action Plan was adopted in October and submitted to the Council and the Commission. It contains 30 policy recommendations. The added value of the OMC applied to research was acknowledged by Member States and the Council. Subsequently a second cycle was launched. #NP# There was some criticism in the first cycle of the information requirements on Member States being relatively heavy. Consequently, the second cycle was launched in early 2005 with clearer and lighter procedures. It focuses on the following five topics: #NP# - Encourage the reform of public research centres and universities, in particular to promote technology transfer to society and industry; #NP# - Design measures to promote the growth of young research-intensive SMEs; #NP# - Design and evaluation of the fiscal measures to promote business research, development and innovation; #NP# - Improve the design and implementation of national policy mixes; and #NP# - IPR ownership regimes in the public sector. #NP# The themes were defined in the light of the results of the first cycle, which they will extend and deepen the analysis. The groups working on the themes will report to CREST, which maintains its particular role in reporting both to the Commission and to the Council. It is expected that a report on the second cycle will be adopted by CREST in March 2006. #NP# In addition to the work of the first cycle, the revised Lisbon Strategy has introduced streamlined national reporting on the Lisbon Strategy. In particular Member States adopt National Reform Programmes, which are presented to the Commission. The National Reform Programmes will integrate reporting on most OMC‚Äôs including the OMC 3% applied to research. #NP# Regarding OMC applied to Human Resources in research, the Steering Group for the Implementation of the Mobility Strategy has been active since 2002. The Steering Group is composed of representatives from Member States and its work has led to very concrete results in improving the environment for the mobility of researchers, as reported on a yearly basis in so-called implementation reports and to CREST in the frame of the implementation of the 3% Action Plan. It has been a very positive experience, both for Member States and for the Commission services. #NP# Trends in research investment #NP# The overall trend of R&D intensity in the EU 25 in the period 2000-2003 is close to stagnation[10]. This weak growth performance is mainly caused by the low growth rate of R&D intensity in the three largest R&D spending countries Germany, France and the UK, which represent around two thirds of the total R&D expenditure in the EU-25. #NP# The annual growth rate in R&D intensity of 0,7% (average annual growth between 2000 and 2003) is far from sufficient to reach the 3% objective by 2010. If this trend remains unchanged ( i.e. assuming a linear forecast applied on the 2000-2003 trend), the EU‚Äôs R&D intensity will be some 2,20% in 2010. The EU‚Äôs R&D intensity, however, grew at a higher rate than that of the US, where private spending on R&D has been significantly decreasing since 2000. As a result, the EU-25 as a whole is slowly catching up with the US. The growth of R&D intensity is higher in Japan than in both the EU and the US, although this seemingly good performance can be partially explained by the low growth rate of Japan‚Äôs GDP (denominator) over recent years. #NP# At EU-25 level, the share of R&D expenditure (GERD) funded by the private sector is significantly lower than in the US and Japan. The contribution of the private sector to the financing of research has even been reduced over recent years in both the EU and the US, although the reduction was of a larger magnitude in the US. Conversely, the share of R&D expenditure funded by the business enterprise sector has been increasing in Japan. #NP# It has frequently been pointed out that the Lisbon 3% target is not simply an expenditure target. It implies a significant increase in numbers of researchers in Europe, and this in turn requires a real expansion of researcher training and a growth in the availability of attractive research careers. It has been estimated that to fulfil the Lisbon/Barcelona targets an extra 1.2 million researchers are needed: 500,000 for renewal of the research labour force (to replace retirees) and 700,000 net new researchers. The number of researchers has been growing from 1997 to 2002 by 22,5% (or 105.000 full time equivalents). #NP# At EU level, the number of post-graduate students (which includes future PhD holders) and of diplomas awarded every year in science and engineering, allows for a continuation of the increase of the number of research personnel at the pace observed since 1997. From 1998 to 2001 the average annual number of PhD level graduates was 76,750, 44% of which were in Science and Engineering. In recent years research graduates in Europe as a whole have been increasing at approximately 4% per year, although a few countries have seen a decline in specific fields such as chemistry and physics. #NP# In terms of the availability of human resource in research the evidence is mixed. Poor career prospects in scientific occupations are often cited as one of the main reasons behind the decline in scientific studies among young people, but across the EU there is little evidence of strong upward pressure on wages for S&T professionals yet. The problems appear to be rather on the demand side than the supply side. The EU would be on track with the Barcelona target if about 60% of science and engineering graduates enter research as a career. However, recent survey figures reveal that only 40% of PhD graduates working in the UK are performing research activities either in academia (22%) or outside academia (18%). This signals profound changes in the labour market for researchers. The sources of demand are more varied than before (with demand emanating from services, transnational firms, and start-ups, for example). Knowledge-intensive services, including sectors of activity such as education, health and social work, employ most of these highly qualified people. #NP# The increased international mobility of researchers and the increased competition to attract the ‚Äòtop performers‚Äô will exert an additional pressure on the management of human resources for R&D in Member States. #NP# Trends in research policy #NP# Although public funding of R&D has experienced significant pressure from overall budget constraints, common trends in upgrading the policy mixes and governance structures for research in line with the Lisbon agenda are clearly observable. The precise array of measures and instruments varies significantly across countries, as does the relative ‚Äòweight‚Äô of the policies, but they share a growing awareness of the need for improved coherence and integration of policies. #NP# A first trend is the convergence of conceptual approaches to RTD policy across the MS towards the so-called ‚Äòsystems‚Äô framework. This policy framework is explicitly adopted in policy making in countries such as Finland, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. It focuses on the overall ‚Äòsystem‚Äô of institutions and organisations ‚Äì specific for each country - that foster research and innovation and condition linkages between actors, and stresses the interconnectedness between different types of policies. #NP# The increasing complexity of the policy mixes is a second trend. The range of long standing policies for research funding (R&D subsidies, technology transfer) is expanded with additional financial instruments (including venture capital operations) and a wide variety of complementary policies related to education and researcher training and mobility, research infrastructures, clustering policies, collaboration and cooperation programmes, IPR regimes, regulatory policies, the role of the public sector as a user of RTD, company formation, sustainable development etc. This ‚Äòhorizontalisation‚Äô of RTD policy has blurred the border line with other policies and argues in favour of greater policy integration. #NP# The growing importance of coordination issues has become a third trend that impacts all countries to different degrees. The Finish experience with the Science and Technology Policy Council has been emulated by a number of countries (e.g. The Netherlands). However, research systems in many countries are too ‚Äòfragmented‚Äô and there is a need for closer integration of the strategies of the different agencies and institutions. #NP# The ‚Äò Europeanisation ‚Äô of Member States research policies is in line with the growing awareness of interdependencies and of the effects of the new stage in globalisation on the restructuring of the research systems. In several countries the debate on the internationalisation of the research system is on the agenda. In all Member States the Lisbon process implicitly supports their modernisation policies, in line with the different actions of the 3% Action Plan. The adoption of R&D investment targets in line with the 3% objective in many Member States constitutes also an explicit reference to the 3% Action Plan. #NP# Outlook for the future #NP# The leading role of research in the knowledge-based society and in competitiveness and growth in Europe was acknowledged and substantiated by a doubling of the funds for research in the Commission's proposals on the Union's financial perspectives for the period 2007-13.[11] #NP# In June 2004 the Communication ""Science and technology, the key to Europe's future""[12] started a political debate on the guidelines for future European research policy and activities. Initiating in this way the preparation of the 7th framework programmes, it proposes to strengthen European research efforts and increase the impact of the Union's action by organising it around six major objectives: creating centres of excellence through collaborative research; launching major European technological initiatives; stimulating basic research (and creating a European Research Council); making Europe more attractive to the best researchers; developing research infrastructures of European interest; and improving the coordination of national research programmes. #NP# Two major consultations of stakeholders followed after the Communication, one on general guidelines for the way ahead and the other on future thematic priorities. An impact study and ex ante assessment of the seventh framework programmes was prepared, with particular regard to the programmes' economic, social and environmental impact and to integrating the socioeconomic and forecasting aspects into the priorities. #NP# Following this debate, the Commission presented its proposals for the 7th Framework programme[13] at the beginning of April 2005. #NP# These proposals are complemented by the Commission‚Äôs proposals for the next generation of Structural Funds programmes, which also emphasize investment in research and innovation as a souce of economic growth. #NP# SOURCES OF FURTHER INFORMATION #NP# More details are included in the Commission Working Document that accompanies this Report.

Confidential treatment of the identity of the interested party submitting the comments may be requested in writing, stating the reasons for the request. #NP# TEXT OF SUMMARY #NP# PROCEDURE #NP# The Commission received by letter of 15 October 2004 a complaint concerning alleged unlawful State aid in favour of Frucona Ko≈°ice, a.s., Slovakia. By letter of 4 January 2005 registered on 17 January 2005, the Slovak republic informed the Commission of possible unlawful State aid and asked for its approval as rescue aid to a company in financial difficulties. #NP# DESCRIPTION OF THE BENEFICIARIES AND THE AID MEASURES #NP# The recipient of the disputed measure is Frucona Ko≈°ice, a.s., active in production of spirit and spirit-based beverages, non-alcoholic beverages, canned fruit and vegetable and vinegar. The company falls within the definition of a small and medium sized enterprise. #NP# The disputed measure is a write-off of a tax debt by the competent tax office in the framework of the so-called arrangement with creditors governed by Act 328/91 Bankruptcy and Arrangement with Creditors. This procedure is a form of collective insolvency procedure under the supervision of a court. It consists in an agreement between the indebted company and its creditors, on the basis of which the creditors are partially satisfied by the debtor and they write-off the remainder of their receivables. #NP# In the framework of such a procedure initiated by Frucona in March 2004, the tax office accepted to write-off 65 % of its receivables. The totality of the receivables amounting to SKK 640793831 (about EUR 16 million), the amount of debt written-off was SKK 416515990 (EUR 10,4 million). The private creditors participating in the arrangement procedure agreed to write-off their receivables on the same terms. The supervising court confirmed this agreement by a decision of 14 July 2004. #NP# The complainant argues that the tax office had a possibility to achieve a satisfaction of its receivables to an extent higher than 35 %, on which the tax office agreed in the arrangement procedure. The complainant in particular stresses that a tax execution procedure and a bankruptcy procedure would lead to a better outcome for the tax office. In this line, the complainant argues that the tax office did not meet the private creditor test and the disputed write-off therefore represents unlawful State aid, which is moreover not compatible with EC Treaty. #NP# Slovakia does not dispute the conclusion that the disputed measure constitutes State aid but requests that this aid is approved as rescue aid to a company in difficulty. #NP# ASSESSMENT #NP# State aid #NP# The Commission notes that the tax office and the private creditors accepted the arrangement with Frucona on the same terms. The Commission, however, also observes that the tax office had other legal instruments by means of which it could have executed its right of a creditor. Namely, the tax office could have initiated a tax execution procedure, or a bankruptcy procedure. In the bankruptcy procedure, as its receivables had been secured, the tax office would have had a position of a separate creditor. The proceeds from sales of the secured assets in the bankruptcy procedure would be used exclusively to satisfy the receivables of the tax office. As a separate creditor voting in a separate group, the tax office had a possibility to veto the proposal of Frucona for arrangement and initiate either the tax execution or the bankruptcy procedure. #NP# On the basis of the information available at this stage, the Commission has doubts that the tax office acted as a private creditor. The Commission therefore doubts that the disputed measure did not distort competition by conferring an advantage that Frucona would not be able to obtain on the private market. The Commission has doubts that the disputed measure does not constitute State aid. #NP# Derogation under Article 87(2) and (3) EC Treaty #NP# The Commission assessed the measure as aid to a company in difficulty in application of the 1999 Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring of firms in difficulty (OJ C 288 of 9.10.1999, p. 2). The Commission has doubts that the disputed measure is compatible as rescue aid, since it is not a temporary assistance, but a non-refundable grant. The Commission has furthermore doubts that the measure is compatible as restructuring aid. The Commission has in particular doubts that Frucona presented a restructuring plan capable of leading the company to a restoration of a long-term viability and that the aid is limited to a minimum necessary. #NP# TEXT OF LETTER #NP# ""Komisia oznamuje Slovensku, ≈æe po presk√∫man√≠ inform√°ci√≠ poskytnut√Ωch va≈°imi org√°nmi o vy≈°≈°ie uvedenom opatren√≠ sa rozhodla zaƒça≈• konanie stanoven√© v ƒçl√°nku 88 ods. 2 Zmluvy o ES. #NP# I.

Tento postup upravuje z√°kon ƒç. 328/91 o konkurze a vyrovnan√≠ (ƒèalej len ""z√°kon o konkurze""). #NP# 8) Vyrovnanie s veriteƒæmi (ƒèalej ""vyrovnacie konanie"") je konanie, ktor√© spolu s konkurzn√Ωm konan√≠m m√° za cieƒæ usporiada≈• finanƒçn√∫ situ√°ciu spoloƒçnost√≠ v √∫padku. Spoloƒçnos≈• je v √∫padku vtedy, keƒè m√° niekoƒæk√Ωch veriteƒæov a nie je schopn√° vyrovna≈• svoje z√°v√§zky do 30 dn√≠ od d√°tumu splatnosti. V konkurznom konan√≠ spoloƒçnos≈• zanikne a jej akt√≠va sa buƒè predaj√∫ nov√©mu majiteƒæovi, alebo sa spoloƒçnos≈• zlikviduje. Oproti tomu vo vyrovnacom konan√≠ spoloƒçnos≈• v √∫padku pokraƒçuje v ƒçinnosti bezo zmeny majiteƒæa. S√∫d uznesen√≠m povol√≠ vyrovnanie, ak s√∫ splnen√© v≈°etky procesn√© a materi√°lne predpoklady. Z√°rove≈à s√∫d vyzve veriteƒæov, aby prihl√°sili svoje pohƒæad√°vky v predp√≠sanej lehote. #NP# 9) Na z√°klade dohody medzi veriteƒæmi a spoloƒçnos≈•ou v √∫padku (ƒèalej len ""vyrovnanie"") potvrdenej s√∫dom zaplat√≠ spoloƒçnos≈• ƒças≈• svojho dlhu a zvy≈°ok sa odp√≠≈°e. #NP# 10) Tzv. oddelen√≠ veritelia, ktor√Ωch pohƒæad√°vky s√∫ zabezpeƒçen√©, a to napr√≠klad z√°lo≈æn√Ωm pr√°vom, maj√∫ privilegovan√© postavenie v hlasovan√≠ o n√°vrhu spoloƒçnosti v √∫padku na vyrovnanie. Podƒæa z√°kona o konkurze, na prijatie n√°vrhu vyrovnania musia v≈°etci oddelen√≠ veritelia hlasova≈• v jeho prospech, zatiaƒæ ƒço hlas ostatn√Ωch veriteƒæov sa poklad√° za rozhoduj√∫ci, ak s√∫hlas√≠ kvalifikovan√° v√§ƒç≈°ina veriteƒæov. Oddelen√≠ veritelia hlasuj√∫ zvl√°≈°≈• v prvej skupine veriteƒæov a maj√∫ pr√°vo vetova≈• n√°vrh. #NP# 11) Z dostupn√Ωch inform√°ci√≠ vypl√Ωva, ≈æe keƒè vyrovnanie nadobudne pr√°voplatnos≈•, nasleduje realizaƒçn√° f√°za, v ktorej dl≈æn√≠k mus√≠ zaplati≈• ƒças≈• dlhu tak, ako sa dohodol s veriteƒæmi, a pr√≠padn√≠ verejn√≠ veritelia musia podnikn√∫≈• ƒèal≈°ie procesn√© kroky na uskutoƒçnenie odpisov. #NP# 12) Tak isto sa ukazuje, ≈æe spoloƒçnos≈• mus√≠ v n√°vrhu na vyrovnanie op√≠sa≈• opatrenia urƒçen√© na jej reorganiz√°ciu a na zabezpeƒçenie plynul√©ho financovania jej ƒçinnosti po vyrovnan√≠. #NP# 13) Dostupn√© inform√°cie naznaƒçuj√∫, ≈æe oddelen√≠ veritelia maj√∫ privilegovan√© postavenie aj v konkurznom konan√≠. V√Ωnosy z predaja zabezpeƒçen√Ωch akt√≠v v konkurznom konan√≠ by sa mali pou≈æi≈• v√Ωhradne na splatenie pohƒæad√°vok oddelen√Ωch veriteƒæov. Ak z tohto predaja nemo≈æno pokry≈• v≈°etky pohƒæad√°vky oddelen√©ho veriteƒæa, tieto sa spoja v druhej skupine s pohƒæad√°vkami ostatn√Ωch veriteƒæov. V druhej skupine sa veritelia uspokojuj√∫ pomerne. #NP# 14) Podƒæa z√°kona ƒç. 511/92 o spr√°ve dan√≠ a poplatkov a o zmen√°ch v s√∫stave √∫zemn√Ωch finanƒçn√Ωch org√°nov (ƒèalej len ""z√°kon o spr√°ve dan√≠"") m√° spoloƒçnos≈• mo≈ænos≈• po≈æiada≈• da≈àov√© org√°ny o odklad platenia dan√≠. Na odlo≈æen√∫ sumu sa √∫ƒçtuje √∫rok a odlo≈æen√Ω dlh mus√≠ by≈• zabezpeƒçen√Ω. #NP# 15) Z√°kon o spr√°ve dan√≠ upravuje da≈àov√© exekuƒçn√© konanie, √∫ƒçelom ktor√©ho je vym√¥c≈• da≈àov√© pohƒæad√°vky ≈°t√°tu prostredn√≠ctvom napr√≠klad predaja nehnuteƒænosti, hnuteƒæn√Ωch akt√≠v alebo podniku ako celku. #NP# 3. Sporn√© opatrenie #NP# 16) Frucona v roku 2003 vyu≈æila in≈°tit√∫t odkladu platenia spotrebnej dane z alkoholu v zmysle z√°kona o spr√°ve dan√≠. #NP# 17) Podƒæa inform√°ci√≠ poskytnut√Ωch slovensk√Ωmi org√°nmi ods√∫hlasil da≈àov√Ω √∫rad r√¥znymi spr√°vnymi rozhodnutiami odklad platby dane splatnej mesaƒçne za obdobie od novembra 2002 do novembra 2003. Celkov√Ω odlo≈æen√Ω dlh predstavoval 477015759 Sk (11 mili√≥nov EUR). Pred ods√∫hlasen√≠m odkladu t√Ωchto platieb da≈àov√Ω √∫rad v s√∫lade so z√°konom zabezpeƒçil ka≈æd√∫ zo svojich pohƒæad√°vok z√°lo≈æn√Ωm pr√°vom v celkovej v√Ω≈°ke 397476726 Sk (10 mili√≥nov EUR). #NP# 18) Keƒè Frucona nezaplatila spotrebn√∫ da≈à za mesiac janu√°r 2004 splatn√∫ 25. febru√°ra 2004, pri≈°la v d√¥sledku toho o licenciu na v√Ωrobu a spracovanie liehu. #NP# 19) Frucona 8. marca 2004 podala na pr√≠slu≈°n√Ω krajsk√Ω s√∫d n√°vrh na vyrovnanie. Krajsk√Ω s√∫d povolil vyrovnacie konanie uznesen√≠m z 29. apr√≠la 2004, keƒè≈æe v≈°etky potrebn√© pr√°vne po≈æiadavky boli splnen√©. Veritelia hlasovali v prospech n√°vrhu na vyrovnanie predlo≈æen√©ho Fruconou na pojedn√°van√≠ d≈àa 9. j√∫la 2004. Vyrovnanie bolo potvrden√© 14. j√∫la 2004 uznesen√≠m dohliadaj√∫ceho krajsk√©ho s√∫du. #NP# 20) Da≈àov√Ω √∫rad napadol toto potvrdzuj√∫ce uznesenie s√∫du. Najvy≈°≈°√≠ s√∫d uznesen√≠m z 25. okt√≥bra 2004 rozhodol, ≈æe odvolanie nebolo pr√≠pustn√©, a vyhl√°sil, ≈æe uznesenie s√∫du potvrdzuj√∫ce vyrovnanie sa stalo pr√°voplatn√Ωm a vykonateƒæn√Ωm 23. j√∫la 2004. #NP# Veritelia sa s Fruconou dohodli na tomto vyrovnan√≠: 35 % dlhu splat√≠ Frucona do jedn√©ho mesiaca od nadobudnutia pr√°voplatnosti vyrovnania a zvy≈°n√Ωch 65 % dlhu jej veritelia odpustia. V≈°etci veritelia boli teda uspokojen√≠ za rovnak√Ωch podmienok. Da≈àov√Ω √∫rad ako jedin√Ω verejn√Ω veriteƒæ s√∫hlasil s odp√≠san√≠m 416515900 Sk (10,6 mili√≥nov EUR). Konkr√©tne sumy pre jednotliv√Ωch veriteƒæov s√∫ uveden√© v nasleduj√∫cej tabuƒæke. #NP# Tab. 2: Stav dlhov Frucony Ko≈°ice pred a po vyrovnacom konan√≠ [v Sk] #NP# Veriteƒæ | Dlh pred vyrovnan√≠m | Dlh po vyrovnan√≠ | Odp√≠san√° suma | #NP# Verejn√Ω | Da≈àov√Ω √∫rad | 640793831 | 224277841 | 416515990 | #NP# S√∫kromn√Ω | Tetra Pak, a. s. | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# MTM-obaly, s.r.o. | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Merkant dru≈æstvo | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Vetropack, s.r.o. | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# SPOLU | | 644591511 | 225607029 | 418984482 | #NP# 21) Vo vyrovnacom konan√≠ vystupoval da≈àov√Ω √∫rad ako oddelen√Ω veriteƒæ a ako tak√Ω hlasoval v prospech vyrovnania zvl√°≈°≈•. Da≈àov√Ω √∫rad mal privilegovan√© postavenie vƒèaka skutoƒçnosti, ≈æe jeho pohƒæad√°vky boli zabezpeƒçen√© v s√∫vislosti s odkladom da≈àov√©ho dlhu Frucony v roku 2003 (pozri odsek 17). V≈°etci ostatn√≠ veritelia hlasovali v prospech navrhovan√©ho vyrovnania. Ich pohƒæad√°vky boli be≈æn√© obchodn√© pohƒæad√°vky nezabezpeƒçen√© ≈æiadnym sp√¥sobom. #NP# 22) Frucona vo svojom n√°vrhu na vyrovnanie v s√∫lade s po≈æiadavkami z√°kona o konkurze op√≠sala reorganizaƒçn√© opatrenia t√Ωkaj√∫ce sa v√Ωroby, distrib√∫cie a person√°lu (vr√°tane prep√∫≈°≈•ania). V organizaƒçnej a person√°lnej oblasti Frucona pl√°novala nasleduj√∫ce opatrenia: vytvorenie univerz√°lnej v√Ωrobnej skupiny pre v≈°etky v√Ωrobn√© ƒçinnosti, reorganiz√°cia svojich dopravn√Ωch zariaden√≠ vyl√∫ƒçen√≠m vozidiel s najni≈æ≈°ou zostatkovou hodnotou a reorganiz√°cia obchodn√Ωch ƒçinnost√≠. Tieto opatrenia malo sprev√°dza≈• prepustenie [do 50] [3] zamestnancov od marca do m√°ja 2004. ƒéal≈°√≠ch 50 zamestnancov malo v tomto obdob√≠ pracova≈• na 60 %. #NP# 23) Vo v√Ωrobnej a technickej oblasti sa v n√°vrhu Frucony uv√°dzalo, ≈æe keƒè≈æe spoloƒçnos≈• pri≈°la o licenciu na v√Ωrobu liehu, pr√≠slu≈°n√© v√Ωrobn√© zariadenia sa od apr√≠la 2004 prenajm√∫. Spoloƒçnos≈• pl√°nuje zn√≠≈æi≈• resp. zru≈°i≈• v√Ωrobu niektor√Ωch nerentabiln√Ωch nealkoholick√Ωch n√°pojov a ak√©mukoƒævek zavedeniu nov√©ho produktu v tejto kateg√≥rii bude predch√°dza≈• anal√Ωza ziskovosti tejto v√Ωroby. #NP# 24) Frucona navy≈°e spom√≠na nasleduj√∫ce opatrenia: re≈°trukturaliz√°cia n√°kladov, ktor√° by mala vypl√Ωva≈• z ni≈æ≈°√≠ch v√Ωrobn√Ωch n√°kladov po zru≈°en√≠ v√Ωroby liehu a zo zru≈°enia ƒçasti vlastnej dopravy spoloƒçnosti; predaj star√©ho zariadenia do ≈°rotu. Frucona pl√°novala preda≈• aj administrat√≠vnu budovu, obchod a rekreaƒçn√© zariadenie za 8 mili√≥nov Sk (200000 EUR) a spomenula mo≈ænos≈• preda≈• alebo prenaja≈• zariadenie na v√Ωrobu octu. #NP# 25) Frucona pl√°novala intenz√≠vny predaj svojich z√°sob hotov√Ωch produktov [4]. #NP# 26) Podƒæa n√°vrhu na vyrovnanie mala Frucona dosta≈• od s√∫kromnej banky p√¥≈æiƒçku na financovanie ƒçasti dlhu, ktor√Ω navrhla splati≈• veriteƒæom vo vyrovnacom konan√≠. Celkov√° v√Ω≈°ka vlastn√Ωch prostriedkov spoloƒçnosti na financovanie vyrovnania predstavovala 210 mili√≥nov Sk (5,25 mili√≥nov EUR). #NP# III. ARGUMENTY STR√ÅN #NP# 1. S≈•a≈æovateƒæ #NP# 27) S≈•a≈æovateƒæ tvrd√≠, ≈æe spr√°vanie da≈àov√©ho √∫radu v tomto pr√≠pade, mimo i v r√°mci vyrovnacieho konania, nezodpoved√° spr√°vaniu s√∫kromn√©ho veriteƒæa, a preto odpis da≈àovej pohƒæad√°vky predstavuje ≈°t√°tnu pomoc, ktor√° nie je kompatibiln√° so spoloƒçn√Ωm trhom, a to ani ako pomoc na z√°chranu, ani ako pomoc na re≈°trukturaliz√°ciu. #NP# 28) S≈•a≈æovateƒæ informoval Komisiu o r√¥znych pr√°vnych n√°strojoch, ktor√© podƒæa jeho n√°zoru mohol da≈àov√Ω √∫rad vyu≈æi≈• s cieƒæom dosiahnu≈• ƒço najvy≈°≈°ie uspokojenie svojich pohƒæad√°vok, ale tak neurobil. S≈•a≈æovateƒæ tvrd√≠, ≈æe predt√Ωm ako Frucona navrhla vyrovnanie, da≈àov√Ω √∫rad mohol zaƒça≈• konkurzn√© konanie, v ktorom by boli jeho pohƒæad√°vky uspokojen√© osobitne a prednostne z predaja zabezpeƒçen√Ωch akt√≠v (privil√©gium oddelen√©ho veriteƒæa). Alternat√≠vne mohol da≈àov√Ω √∫rad zaƒça≈• da≈àov√© exekuƒçn√© konanie, ktor√© by mu umo≈ænilo preda≈• akt√≠va Frucony. #NP# 29) Okrem toho mohol da≈àov√Ω √∫rad podƒæa s≈•a≈æovateƒæa odmietnu≈• navrhovan√© vyrovnanie. Keƒè≈æe mal pr√°vo samostatn√©ho hlasu, jeho postavenie bolo teda rozhoduj√∫ce. Ak by da≈àov√Ω √∫rad nes√∫hlasil s n√°vrhom Frucony, vyrovnacie konanie by sa ukonƒçilo a da≈àov√Ω √∫rad by mohol iniciova≈• konkurz alebo da≈àov√∫ exek√∫ciu. #NP# 2. Slovensk√© org√°ny #NP# 30) Slovensko nepopiera, ≈æe sporn√© opatrenie predstavuje ≈°t√°tnu pomoc, a ≈æiada jeho schv√°lenie ako pomoc na z√°chranu pre spoloƒçnos≈• vo finanƒçn√Ωch ≈•a≈ækostiach. #NP# 31) Slovensk√© org√°ny v≈°ak objasnili, ≈æe da≈àov√Ω √∫rad podnikol √∫vodn√© procesn√© kroky podƒæa z√°kona o spr√°ve dan√≠ s cieƒæom zaƒça≈• da≈àov√© exekuƒçn√© konanie. Podanie n√°vrhu na vyrovnanie na krajsk√Ω s√∫d 8. marca 2004 v≈°ak zaƒçatiu exekuƒçn√©ho konania zabr√°nilo. #NP# IV. HODNOTENIE #NP# 1. ≈†t√°tna pomoc v zmysle ƒçl√°nku 87 ods. 1 Zmluvy o ES #NP# 32) ƒål√°nok 87 ods. 1 Zmluvy o ES vyhlasuje ak√∫koƒævek pomoc poskytnut√∫ ƒçlensk√Ωm ≈°t√°tom alebo zo ≈°t√°tnych prostriedkov v akejkoƒævek forme, ktor√° naru≈°uje alebo hroz√≠ naru≈°en√≠m hospod√°rskej s√∫≈•a≈æe t√Ωm, ≈æe zv√Ωhod≈àuje urƒçit√© podniky alebo v√Ωrobu urƒçit√Ωch tovarov za nezl√∫ƒçiteƒæn√∫ so spoloƒçn√Ωm trhom, pokiaƒæ ovplyv≈àuje obchod medzi ƒçlensk√Ωmi ≈°t√°tmi. #NP# 33) Odpis verejn√©ho dlhu predstavuje pou≈æitie ≈°t√°tnych prostriedkov. Spoloƒçnos≈• je ƒçinn√° hlavne v oblasti v√Ωroby n√°pojov, v ktorej sa medzi ƒçlensk√Ωmi ≈°t√°tmi obchoduje. #NP# 34) Zost√°va urƒçi≈•, ƒçi sporn√© opatrenie nar√∫≈°a hospod√°rsku s√∫≈•a≈æ t√Ωm, ≈æe pr√≠jemcovi poskytuje podporu, ktor√∫ by na s√∫kromnom trhu nedostal. In√Ωmi slovami, Komisia mus√≠ urƒçi≈•, ƒçi sa ≈°t√°t vo vyrovnacom konan√≠ spr√°val ako s√∫kromn√Ω veriteƒæ. #NP# 35) V tomto kontexte Komisia poznamen√°va, ≈æe Slovensko nepopiera, ≈æe predmetn√© opatrenie predstavuje ≈°t√°tnu pomoc. #NP# 36) Z dostupn√Ωch inform√°ci√≠ je jasn√©, ≈æe predmetn√© vyrovnanie obsahuje rovnak√© podmienky vyrovnania pre s√∫kromn√Ωch veriteƒæov i da≈àov√Ω √∫rad: 35 % pohƒæad√°vok sa m√° splati≈• veriteƒæom do jedn√©ho mesiaca a 65 % pohƒæad√°vok sa odp√≠≈°e. #NP# 37) Zd√° sa v≈°ak, ≈æe pr√°vna situ√°cia da≈àov√©ho √∫radu a ostatn√Ωch veriteƒæov nebola rovnak√°. Po prv√©, da≈àov√Ω √∫rad mal na rozdiel od s√∫kromn√Ωch veriteƒæov pr√°vo na vlastn√Ω n√°vrh zaƒça≈• ≈°peci√°lne da≈àov√© exekuƒçn√© konanie, a t√Ωm uspokoji≈• svoje pohƒæad√°vky v maxim√°lnom rozsahu prostredn√≠ctvom, napr√≠klad, predaja nehnuteƒænosti, strojn√©ho zariadenia, alebo predaja podniku ako celku. V tejto s√∫vislosti Komisia poznamen√°va, ≈æe hodnota zabezpeƒçen√Ωch akt√≠v predstavovala 397476726 Sk (10 mili√≥nov EUR), priƒçom da≈àov√Ω √∫rad vyrovnal svoje pohƒæad√°vky vo v√Ω≈°ke 224277841 Sk (5,6 mili√≥na EUR). #NP# 38) Po druh√©, pohƒæad√°vky da≈àov√©ho √∫radu za obdobie od novembra 2002 do novembra 2003 boli zabezpeƒçen√© z√°lo≈æn√Ωm pr√°vom na akt√≠vach Frucony vytvoren√Ωm v s√∫vislosti s odkladom platby dlhu Frucony na toto obdobie. V√Ωnos z predaja zabezpeƒçen√Ωch akt√≠v v konkurznom konan√≠ by sa pou≈æil v√Ωluƒçne na splatenie pohƒæad√°vok da≈àov√©ho √∫radu ako jedin√©ho oddelen√©ho veriteƒæa. Pohƒæad√°vky da≈àov√©ho √∫radu nepokryt√© v prvej skupine by sa zaplatili spolu s pohƒæad√°vkami s√∫kromn√Ωch veriteƒæov z toho, ƒço by zostalo z akt√≠v spoloƒçnosti po predaji zabezpeƒçen√Ωch akt√≠v. Veritelia v druhej skupine s√∫ uspokojen√≠ pomerne. V tejto s√∫vislosti Komisia pozoruje, ≈æe zatiaƒæ ƒço pohƒæad√°vky da≈àov√©ho √∫radu predstavovali 640 mili√≥nov Sk (16 mili√≥nov EUR), s√∫hrn pohƒæad√°vok ≈°tyroch s√∫kromn√Ωch veriteƒæov predstavoval 3,8 mili√≥na Sk (95000 EUR), ƒço zodpoved√° 0,6 % celkov√Ωch pohƒæad√°vok. Vzhƒæadom na tento pomer sa zd√°, ≈æe keƒè≈æe v√Ωnosy z ƒèal≈°ieho predaja by sa rozdelili pomerne, da≈àov√Ω √∫rad by profitoval najviac aj v druhej skupine. Uspokojenie s√∫kromn√Ωch veriteƒæov v druhej skupine by bolo minim√°lne. #NP# 39) Po tretie, da≈àov√Ω √∫rad po zaƒçat√≠ vyrovnacieho konania mohol zabr√°ni≈• vyrovnaniu odmietnut√≠m hlasova≈• v jeho prospech. #NP# 40) Z uveden√©ho sa zd√°, ≈æe zatiaƒæ ƒço s√∫kromn√≠ veritelia mali z√°ujem hlasova≈• pre navrhovan√© vyrovnanie, lebo im zabezpeƒçovalo vy≈°≈°√≠ v√Ωnos (pokrytie 35 % ich pohƒæad√°vok), da≈àov√Ω √∫rad by dosiahol vy≈°≈°√≠ v√Ωnos, ak by pou≈æil konkurzn√© konanie alebo da≈àov√∫ exek√∫ciu. #NP# 41) Na z√°klade inform√°ci√≠ dostupn√Ωch v tomto ≈°t√°diu Komisia pochybuje, ≈æe da≈àov√Ω √∫rad konal ako s√∫kromn√Ω veriteƒæ. Komisia preto pochybuje, ≈æe sporn√© opatrenie nenaru≈°ilo hospod√°rsku s√∫≈•a≈æ, a to udelen√≠m v√Ωhody, ktor√∫ by Frucona nemohla z√≠ska≈• na trhu. #NP# 2. V√Ωnimka podƒæa ƒçl√°nku 87 ods. 2 a ods. 3 Zmluvy o ES #NP# 42) Prim√°rnym cieƒæom sporn√©ho opatrenia je pom√¥c≈• spoloƒçnosti v ≈•a≈ækostiach. V tak√Ωchto pr√≠padoch mo≈æno uplatni≈• v√Ωnimku ƒçl√°nku 87 ods. 3 p√≠sm. c) Zmluvy o ES, ktor√° umo≈æ≈àuje povoli≈• ≈°t√°tnu pomoc na podporu rozvoja niektor√Ωch hospod√°rskych sektorov, ak t√°to pomoc negat√≠vne neovplyv≈àuje podmienky obchodovania do takej miery, ktor√° by bola v rozpore so spoloƒçn√Ωm z√°ujmom, a ak s√∫ splnen√© pr√≠slu≈°n√© podmienky. #NP# 43) Vzhƒæadom na v√Ωrobn√© portf√≥lio pr√≠jemcu Komisia hodnotila, ƒçi sa v tomto pr√≠pade uplat≈àuj√∫ ≈°peci√°lne pravidl√° vz≈•ahuj√∫ce sa na sektor poƒænohospod√°rstva. Po porovnan√≠ obratu spoloƒçnosti za roky 2002 ‚Äì 2004 v r√¥znych segmentoch jej v√Ωrobn√©ho sortimentu (pozri tab. 1) Komisia do≈°la k z√°veru, ≈æe v√§ƒç≈°ina produktov Frucony nie s√∫ produkty spadaj√∫ce pod pr√≠lohu I Zmluvy o ES. Preto sa uplat≈àuj√∫ v≈°eobecn√© pravidl√° ≈°t√°tnej pomoci. #NP# 44) Pomoc na z√°chranu a re≈°trukturaliz√°ciu spoloƒçnost√≠ v ≈•a≈ækostiach sa v s√∫ƒçasnosti upravuje usmernen√≠m Spoloƒçenstva o ≈°t√°tnej pomoci na z√°chranu a re≈°trukturaliz√°ciu firiem v ≈•a≈ækostiach [5] (ƒèalej len ""nov√© usmernenie""), ktor√© nahr√°dza predch√°dzaj√∫ce znenie prijat√© v roku 1999 [6] (ƒèalej len ""usmernenie z roku 1999""). #NP# 45) Prechodn√© ustanovenia nov√©ho usmernenia stanovuj√∫, ≈æe nov√© usmernenie sa uplat≈àuje na hodnotenie akejkoƒævek pomoci na z√°chranu alebo re≈°trukturaliz√°ciu poskytnutej bez povolenia Komisie (nez√°konn√° pomoc), ak je niektor√° ƒças≈• pomoci alebo cel√° pomoc poskytnut√° po 1. okt√≥bri 2004, teda po dni uverejnenia nov√©ho usmernenia v √öradnom vestn√≠ku Eur√≥pskej √∫nie (bod 104, prv√Ω pododsek). Ak v≈°ak bola pomoc nez√°konne poskytnut√° pred 1. okt√≥brom 2004, zis≈•ovanie sa vedie na z√°klade usmernenia platn√©ho v ƒçase, keƒè bola pomoc poskytnut√° (bod 104, druh√Ω pododsek). #NP# 46) Komisia poznamen√°va, ≈æe schv√°lenie vyrovnania da≈àov√Ωm √∫radom nadobudlo pr√°voplatnos≈• 23. j√∫la 2004 [7]. Pomoc bola teda nez√°konne poskytnut√° pred 1. okt√≥brom 2004. Preto sa uplat≈àuje usmernenie z roku 1999, ktor√© platilo v ƒçase poskytnutia pomoci. #NP# 2.1.

The present notice sets out the detailed arrangements for the transmission of the electronic notification forms, which will be compulsory as of 1 January 2006. It is based on Article 3(6) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 794/2004 of 21 April 2004 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the Treaty. Article 3(6) requests the Commission to publish these arrangements before 30 September 2005. The advisory Committee for State aids has been consulted. #NP# 2. The notifications forms of Annexe I Part 1 and 2 of Regulation (EC) No 794/2004 will be made available in a Web-application, the different supplementary information sheets (part III of Annexe I) will be annexed as a word document. The address of the web application will be the following: #NP# https://webgate.cec.eu.int/competition/sani #NP# 3. Member States are requested to nominate a Local Administrator as well as the person authorized to validate notifications as well as a replacement. The Commission will grant them a login and password for the web-application which will make sure that the incoming notifications are authorized. #NP# Member States will have the possibility to sub-delegate certain access rights to other persons depending on the internal organisation of the Member States administration for the State aid notifications. The sub-delegation shall not modify the authorization to validate the notification. #NP# 4. Subsequent correspondence between the Member States and the Commission relating o the same notification will be sent electronically via a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) encrypted e-mail system. #NP# The address for this e-mail system will be a functional mailbox established within each DG responsible for the treatment of State aid notifications. Each DG will introduce a certification system which will make the e-mail correspondence secure and confidential. #NP# 5. Upon validation of the notification form and the corresponding Supplementary Information Sheet (SIS), the system will dispatch the notification to the Sec. Gen. and transfer the core data into the ISIS (Integrated State Aid Information System) database. Following that a notification of receipt will automatically be send to the notifying Member State indicating the delay within which the Commission intends to assess the case preliminary as well as the DG which the case has been attributed to by the system. #NP# The delay will depend upon whether the Member State avails himself of the simplified procedure of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 794/2004. #NP# 6. In the case of the simplified procedures, the Commission will use its best endeavours to preliminarily assess the case within a month's period. #NP# In all other cases, the delay will be fixed at two months. #NP# Subsequent correspondence relating to the particular notification will be exchanged between the Member State and the DG responsible via a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) secured system. Member States will inform the Commission of their representative authorized to receive the key and to manage the security system. Two keys will be available per Member State. Member States are responsible for the security guarantee of their own e-mailing system between the sending point and the Authorized Disclosure Officer (ADO) #NP# 7. Withdrawal of notifications should be done via the same secured e-mail system. Decisions that a notification is deemed to be withdrawn are decisions of the Commission; they will be communicated to the Member State through the secured e-mail system. #NP# 8. Pre-notifications shall not be submitted via the web-based system, but shall be sent by e-mail. Upon finalisation of the informal contacts Member States will be requested to fill in the formal notification through the web-application. #NP# 9.

115,32005D0408,en,2005,"Commission Decision #NP# of 11 November 2003 #NP# declaring a concentration compatible with the common market and the EEA Agreement #NP# (Case COMP/M.2621 ‚Äî SEB/Moulinex) #NP# (notified under document number C(2003) 4157) #NP# (Only the French text is authentic) #NP# (Text with EEA relevance) #NP# (2005/408/EC) #NP# On 11 November 2003 the Commission adopted a decision in a merger case pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 of 21 December 1989 on the control of concentrations between undertakings [1], and in particular Article 8(2) of that Regulation. A non-confidential version of the full decision can be found in the authentic language of the case and in the working languages of the Commission on the website of the Directorate-General for Competition, at the following address: http://europa.eu.int/comm/competition/index_en.html #NP# (1) The case concerns the acquisition by the company SEB of control of certain assets of the company Moulinex (brands, some production plants and some marketing subsidiaries); the transaction was notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 on 13 November 2001. #NP# (2) SEB and Moulinex are two French undertakings operating in the small electrical household appliances sector. Both operate worldwide in the sector. SEB markets its products mainly under two world brands, ""Tefal"" and ""Rowenta"" and Moulinex markets its products mainly under the international brands ""Moulinex"" and ""Krups"". #NP# (3) The acquisition of Moulinex‚Äôs assets by SEB took place within the framework of receivership proceedings involving the Moulinex group. The Commission adopted two Decisions on the merger on 8 January 2002. In the first, the Commission referred examination of the effects of the merger on competition in France to the French competition authorities, pursuant to Article 9 of the merger Regulation. In the second, pursuant to Article 6(2) of the merger Regulation, it authorised the merger in the other countries subject to the licensing of the Moulinex trade mark to independent third parties in nine countries of the European Economic Area (Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark and Greece). The Court of First Instance of the European Communities annulled the authorising Decision as regards the countries for which no commitments had been given, namely Spain, Finland, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom [2]. This new Decision re-examines the competitive impact of the transaction in those five countries. #NP# (4) On 3 November 2003, at its 120th meeting, the Advisory Committee on Concentrations unanimously delivered a favourable opinion on the Commission‚Äôs draft authorising Decision. #NP# (5) In a report drawn up on 4 November 2003, the Hearing Officer concluded that the right of the parties to be heard had been complied with. #NP# I. DEFINITION OF THE RELEVANT MARKETS #NP# (6) The Decision defines the product markets in terms of categories of small electrical household appliances corresponding to a specific use and a specific function. There are 13 product markets: deep fryers, mini ovens, toasters, sandwich makers and waffle makers, appliances for informal meals, electric barbecues and indoor grills, rice cookers and steam cookers, electric filter coffee makers, kettles, espresso machines, blenders and food preparation appliances, irons/ironing stations and personal care appliances. #NP# (7) The relevant geographic markets are national. However, market conditions in the United Kingdom and Ireland are uniform. Since brands and prices are identical in the two countries, suppliers cannot pursue an autonomous pricing policy in either country without seeing orders transferred to the other country. The two countries are therefore considered to form one and the same geographic market for the relevant products. #NP# II. MARKET ANALYSIS #NP# (8) SEB‚Äôs competitive position is examined in the following countries or areas: Spain, Finland, Italy and the United Kingdom/Ireland. #NP# The competitive potential represented by Moulinex #NP# (9) Moulinex‚Äôs sales fell sharply in 2001 and 2002 compared with 2000 as a result of difficulties created by the insolvency of the group. The Commission examined whether the decline was structural or whether Moulinex had the capacity to recover its previous positions. #NP# (10) The market survey shows that Moulinex‚Äôs capacity to recover its lost market shares will depend not only on the value of the brands brought in by the merger, but also on other factors such as the innovative, commercial and financial capacities of its new owner. The recovery potential to be taken into account in the competitive analysis is thus reduced by the impact of these other factors, since they do not involve any direct causal link with the merger. #NP# (11) Furthermore, the Commission takes the view that where the Moulinex brand is no longer being used, it is very unlikely to be able to recover the market shares it had in 2000. The same applies where its market shares have been taken by competitors who are already strong on the small electrical household appliances markets, such as Philips, Braun or DeLonghi, and/or where distributors do not consider Moulinex or Krups a must have brand. #NP# Methods of analysis #NP# (12) For each of the relevant markets, the Commission established market shares on the basis of the declared sales of most of the competitors operating on the market. #NP# (13) In each of the countries or areas examined, the Decision looks at the effects of the transaction both from the horizontal point of view (effects of the combined strength of the new entity market by market) and from the non-horizontal point of view (effect of the combined strength of the new entity in the small electrical household appliances sector as a whole, even where there is no overlap on a particular market). #NP# (14) For the combination of SEB and the Moulinex assets taken over to have harmful non-horizontal effects on competition, the following conditions must be met: #NP# - the new entity must have a range of brands that gives it a significant competitive advantage in the small electrical household appliances sector as a whole, #NP# - the combined entity must have positions of strength on some markets that it could exploit to create or strengthen dominant positions on other markets. Such positions of strength might be created by the transaction itself, or might already be held by one or other party. #NP# (15) As regards examination of the horizontal effects, the Commission has structured its Decision as follows: (i) markets where the parties have a combined market share of less than 25 %; (ii) markets with non-significant overlaps, and (iii) markets with significant overlaps and a combined market share in excess of 25 %. #NP# (16) This approach gives the following table. #NP# | Markets where the parties have a market share of less than 25 % | Markets with non-significant overlaps | Markets with a combined market share in excess of 25 % | #NP# Spain | Espressos machines, filter coffee makers, barbecues/grills, steam cookers, sandwich/waffle makers, deep fryers, irons/ironing stations, personal care appliances. | Food preparation appliances, informal meal appliances. | Toasters, kettles, mini ovens. | #NP# Finland | Irons/ironing stations, steam cookers, toasters, filter coffee makers, deep fryers, informal meal appliances, personal care appliances. | Espresso machines, barbecues/grills, food preparation appliances. | Mini ovens, kettles, sandwich/waffle makers. | #NP# Italy | Espresso machines, deep fryers, mini ovens, toasters, personal care appliances. | | Kettles, informal meal appliances, sandwich/waffle makers, steam cookers, food preparation appliances, irons/ironing stations, filter coffee makers, barbecues/grills. | #NP# United Kingdom/Ireland | Toasters, kettles, mini ovens, filter coffee makers, sandwich/waffle makers, barbecues/grills, food preparation appliances, personal care appliances. | Espresso machines, irons/ironing stations. | Informal meal appliances, steam cookers, deep fryers. | #NP# (17) For the purposes of this summary, only the markets belonging to the third category are commented on in detail. The Decision concludes that there is no risk of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position on the markets where the parties have a market share of less than 25 % and on the markets where the addition of market shares will not be significant. #NP# A. The Spanish markets #NP# (18) On the small electrical household appliances markets, the supply side comprises competitors with a strong international presence such as Philips ([15-20] % of sales on the small electrical household appliances markets), SEB [10-20] %* [3], Braun [15-20] %, BSH [0-5] % and DeLonghi [0-5] %. Local operators account for a more modest overall market share: these are Taurus [5-10] %, Jata, Solac and Fagor ([0-5] % each). #NP# (19) The demand side is fairly concentrated and stems from the following forms of distribution: hypermarkets (Carrefour, Auchan, Hipercor), department stores (El Corte Ingles), specialist stores (Media Markt) and traditional small traders, most of whom have organised themselves into purchasing groups (Densa, Gestesa, Segesa). #NP# (20) Moulinex‚Äôs sales fell significantly across the board between 2000 and 2002. The fall amounted to at least 20 % of sales on each of the relevant markets. Even if the image of the Krups and Moulinex brands has hardly suffered in the eyes of the final consumer, their potential for recovery is limited by the success of the new entity‚Äôs competitors in consolidating their positions on the markets. #NP# (21) The risk of creating or strengthening dominant positions may be dismissed on the following markets (where the combined market share is in excess of 25 % and there is a significant overlap): toasters, kettles and mini ovens. #NP# (22) On the markets in toasters and kettles, SEB will hold market shares of [20 to 30] %*. The merger will not result in the combining of must-have brands (only Moulinex is a must-have brand for toasters, and only Tefal is a must-have brand for kettles). The merged entity of SEB and Moulinex will face competitors with sizeable market shares (between [15 and 20] % at most) and having reputable brands. Consequently, it is unlikely that Moulinex will recover the competitive potential it had in 2000. At all events, with a maximum combined market share of [25-35] %, in the absence of non-horizontal effects and owing to the presence of well established competitors, the risk that the merger might result in the creation or strengthening of a dominant position on these markets can be dismissed. #NP# (23) On the market in mini ovens, SEB‚Äôs position is stronger. The figures show that the new entity would have a share of [30-40] % of the Spanish market. Its main competitors are DeLonghi [20-25] %, Jata [5-10] %, Ufesa and Severin ([5-10] % each). Although they have smaller market shares than the new entity, these operators none the less have must-have brands and a broad range covering all the capacities available on the market (10/12 litres, 18/20 litres, 26/28 litres). Moreover, prices are tending to fall on this market, there is regular innovation and entry barriers are low. Lastly, although not included in the relevant market, microwave ovens with grill pose a not inconsiderable competitive constraint, and the Moulinex brand has limited potential for recovering the position it held in 2000. #NP# (24) The merger will not allow the new entity to exploit non-horizontal effects. Its range of brands and its positions of strength on certain markets are not sufficient to give it any leverage, particularly in view of the position held by its competitors as regards these two aspects. #NP# (25) In the light of the above, the notified operation is not likely to create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded on the various markets in small electrical household appliances in Spain. #NP# B. The Finnish markets #NP# (26) Overall, SEB ([5-10] %* of sales on the markets in small electrical household appliances) is only the third largest operator on the Finnish markets after Braun [10-15] %* and in particular Philips [25-30] %*. AEG ([5-10] %*) holds comparable positions to that of the new entity. Severin, DeLonghi, BSH and national operators such as OBH/Nordica and Rommelsbacher are also present, but with smaller shares (between 0 and 5 % each) and have a significant presence on certain specific markets. #NP# (27) Distribution in Finland is amongst the most concentrated in Europe: Kesko and E. Partners each account for around [20-25] %* of sales to the final consumer. Stockman is also in a strong position with [15-20] %*. #NP# (28) Moulinex‚Äôs sales fell dramatically between 2000 and 2002 (by at least 50 % on each of the relevant markets). Moulinex is unlikely to recover its lost market shares, given (i) the scale of the decline and (ii) the consolidation of market positions held by competitors with reputed brands. #NP# (29) The risk of dominant positions being created or strengthened can be dismissed on the following markets (where the combined market share is in excess of 25 % and there is a significant overlap): mini ovens, kettles and sandwich/waffle makers. #NP# (30) The markets in mini ovens and sandwich/waffle makers are included in this category because of the large market shares held by the combined entity in 2000 ([40-50] %* and [20-30] %* respectively). Since then, however, its positions have shrunk markedly, and in 2002 it had market shares of the order of [0-10] %* on each of the two markets. Furthermore, Severin increased its market share in mini ovens from [30-35] % to [50-55] %, while many operators have must have brands on the market in sandwich/waffle makers. Furthermore, Moulinex has, for the time being, withdrawn from the market in mini ovens. #NP# (31) On the market in kettles, the new entity remains the market leader with a market share of [30-40] %* both in 2000 and in 2002. The stability in its market shares is due to the fact that the decline in Moulinex‚Äôs sales was offset by an increase in SEB‚Äôs sales. Philips with [20-25] % and, to a lesser extent, Braun and Severin are strong competitors with must-have brands, consolidated by Moulinex‚Äôs difficulties and able to exercise a counterweight to the new entity. Furthermore, Moulinex is not generally cited as a must-have brand, which makes it unlikely that it can recover its competitive potential. #NP# (32) The merger does not allow the new entity to exploit non-horizontal effects. Its range of brands and its positions of strength on certain markets are not sufficient to give it any leverage, particularly in view of the position held by its competitors as regards these two aspects. #NP# (33) In the light of the above, the notified operation is not likely to create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the common market or a substantial part thereof on the various markets in small electrical household appliances in Finland. #NP# C. The Italian markets #NP# (34) The leading supplier on the Italian markets in small electrical household appliances is DeLonghi ([20-30] %* of sales on the markets in small electrical household appliances), closely followed by the new combined entity SEB/Moulinex ([15-25] %*) and Braun and Philips ([5-15] %* each). BSH has smaller market shares (less than 5 % overall). Domestic competitors have generally smaller market shares overall, but may nevertheless hold not insignificant positions on certain markets. This is the case with Imetec (food preparation appliances and sandwich/waffle makers), Polti (irons) and Saeco (70 % of the market in espresso machines). #NP# (35) The structure on the demand side is comparable to that on the supply side, but is less concentrated. Almost two thirds of distribution takes place via large chains, purchasing groups and specialised dealers. #NP# (36) Moulinex‚Äôs sales fell between 2000 and 2002. Its potential for recovery appears severely restricted by the presence of competitors with must-have brands which have taken advantage of Moulinex‚Äôs difficulties to enter or consolidate their positions on markets. #NP# (37) The risk of dominant positions being created or strengthened may be dismissed on all the markets where the market share is in excess of 25 % or with a significant overlap, namely: irons and ironing stations, kettles, informal meal appliances, sandwich/waffle makers, food preparation appliances, filter coffee makers, barbecues/grills and steam cookers. #NP# (38) It is in the market in irons and ironing stations that the new entity‚Äôs position appears weakest amongst the eight markets cited above with [20-30] %* of sales, which is comparable to that of DeLonghi. It should be noted that Moulinex is traditionally not strong here, both in 2000 and in 2002. Its products are not carried by any must-have brand. The new entity‚Äôs position is subject to strong competition, given the situation of competitor groups: Philips, Imetec and Polti each hold [10-15] % of the market and all have must-have brands. The new entity cannot add any new must-have brand resulting from the merger to the existing must-have brands (Rowenta and, to a lesser extent, Tefal). #NP# (39) On the markets in kettles, informal meal appliances, sandwich/waffle makers, food preparation appliances, filter coffee makers and barbecues/grills, the new entity‚Äôs market share is [25-35] %. It is the market leader here. On each of these markets, it will face competitors with sizeable market shares and reputable brands. The identity of its competitors varies from market to market, but is generally the traditional international suppliers (Philips in the case of kettles, sandwich/waffle makers and food preparation appliances; Braun in the case of kettles, sandwich/waffle makers, food preparation appliances and filter coffee makers; Severin in the case of informal meal appliances; DeLonghi in the case of sandwich/waffle makers, food preparation appliances and barbecues/grills) and local operators (Imetec in the case of sandwich/waffle makers). In general, the merger does not combine two must-have brands on these markets. On some markets, the Commission carried out a more detailed analysis (by price segment or by product type) in order to confirm its analysis on the overall market. #NP# (40) The market in steam cookers is the one on which the new entity has the strongest position with [35-45] % of sales. Its market share has increased by 20 % since 2000 thanks to the improvement in SEB‚Äôs sales. A number of factors prompted the Commission to qualify this market position. Firstly, most of the new entity‚Äôs sales were made through one distributor, Esselunga, via its fidelity catalogue. SEB is thus very dependent on this distributor. Secondly, Moulinex no longer markets products, its sales being attributable only to the running down of its stocks. It also appears that SEB does not plan to relaunch Moulinex products, Moulinex not being a must-have brand in Italy. Lastly, competitors have advanced, including Braun [10-15] % and Girmi [5-10] %, which tripled its sales in two years. #NP# (41) The merger does not allow the new entity to exploit non-horizontal effects. Its range of brands and its positions of strength on certain markets are not sufficient to give it any leverage, particularly in view of the position held by its competitors as regards these two aspects. #NP# (42) In the light of the above, the notified transaction is not likely to create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the common market or a substantial part thereof on the various markets in small electrical household appliances in Italy. #NP# D. The markets in the United Kingdom and Ireland #NP# (43) There are a large number of suppliers in these two countries with almost identical overall positions in each of them, at around 10 %. These are Braun, SEB, Philips, DeLonghi, Morphy Richards and Salton. Somewhat smaller market shares are held by BSH and Home Products International (around 5 %). A particular feature of the British market is the presence and reputation of local operators such as Morphy Richards, Salton and, to a lesser extent, Home Products International. #NP# (44) Distribution is highly concentrated, with Argos being by far the largest distributor ([30-35] %* of sales). The five largest distributors account for half of sales. #NP# (45) Moulinex‚Äôs sales fell substantially between 2000 and 2002, by at least 30 % on all markets and by more than 50 % on most markets. The new entity has little chance of recovering its 2002 positions because of the highly competitive situation on the British market. Moulinex is cited as a second-rank brand, while Krups‚Äôs potential appears to be better, but its presence is limited to certain markets, including espresso machines. #NP# (46) The risk of dominant positions being created or strengthened can be dismissed on all the markets where there is a market share in excess of 25 % and a significant overlap, namely informal meal appliances, steam cookers and deep fryers. #NP# (47) On those three markets, Moulinex‚Äôs positions declined considerably between 2000 and 2002. Its market shares fell from [5-15] %* to less than 5 %, or indeed zero where Moulinex withdrew from the market (informal meal appliances). Consequently, although SEB has not inconsiderable market shares ([30-35] % in the case of steam cookers, [25-35] % in the case of deep fryers and [10-15] % in the case of informal meal appliances), these will not be strengthened by the merger. SEB is faced on each of these markets with competitors holding must-have brands, while the merger would not give it any additional must-have brands. New market entrants have also appeared on these markets, including the market in steam cookers: Russell Hobbs, Hinari and Magimix. These brands directly achieved sales in excess of Moulinex‚Äôs sales in 2000. On the market in deep fryers, an analysis by price quartile confirmed the conclusions drawn on the overall market: on the lowest quartiles, the presence of distributors‚Äô own brands became firmer. #NP# (48) The merger will not allow the new entity to exploit non-horizontal effects. Its range of brands and its positions of strength on certain markets are not sufficient to give it any leverage, particularly in view of the position held by its competitors as regards these two aspects. #NP# (49) In the light of the above, the notified operation is not likely to create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the common market or a substantial part thereof on the various markets in small electrical household appliances in the United Kingdom and Ireland. #NP# III. CONCLUSION #NP# (50) For the reasons set out above, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified merger and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA Agreement, subject to the continued implementation of the commitments which were proposed during the first proceedings [4]. This Decision is taken on the basis of Article 8(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 and Article 57 of the EEA Agreement. #NP# [1] OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 1.

Description #NP# The Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) approved, in March 2002, a plan of activities to protect against nuclear terrorism (GOV/2002/10). Furthermore, the document: ""Measures to Strengthen International Cooperation in Nuclear, Radiation, Transport Safety and Waste Management: Promoting Effective and Sustainable National Regulatory Infrastructure for the Control of Radiation Sources"" (GOV/2004/52-GC(48)/15) includes parts that are relevant to the IAEA-EU cooperation under the EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. This provides a comprehensive approach to nuclear security, including the regulatory controls, accountability and protection of nuclear and other radioactive materials in use, storage and transport, ""from cradle to grave"", in the short term as well as in the long term. However, if protection should fail, or in the case of material that is not yet subject to protection at its location, measures must be established to detect theft or attempts to smuggle the material. #NP# International safeguards, as implemented by the IAEA, represent a key means of verifying the fulfilment by states of commitments not to use nuclear material or technology to develop nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. Conclusion of a comprehensive safeguards agreement [1] and an additional protocol thereto [2] is an important commitment by a state with respect to the security and control of nuclear material and nuclear-related material and activities within its territory, under its jurisdiction or carried out under its control anywhere. In this respect, it is of utmost importance that the required national implementing legislation is in place in order to enable authorised governmental entities to exercise the necessary regulatory functions and to govern the conduct of any person engaged in regulated activities. #NP# Support for these efforts is in high demand in all IAEA Member States as well as in states which are not yet members of the IAEA. However, the projects related to strengthening nuclear security are primarily focused upon countries in south-eastern Europe: Bulgaria, Turkey, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova and Romania, in the Central Asia region: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, in the Caucasus region: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, in Northern Africa: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt, and in the Mediterranean region and in the Middle East: Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Jordan. The activities under the project dealing with assistance in the development of national legislation related to the safeguards agreement and additional protocol (Project 4), will be implemented in the countries identified as a result of the political priorities set by the EU. #NP# Initially, needs for improved nuclear security will be evaluated in the new countries coming under this Joint Action in order to identify priorities for support. For that purpose, a team of recognised experts will evaluate the present status of nuclear security measures already in place in these countries and give recommendations on improvements. The recommendations will constitute a platform for the definition of subsequent assistance, covering present status and need for improvement as regards prevention, detection of and response to malicious acts involving nuclear and other radioactive materials, including those in non-nuclear use, and of nuclear facilities. #NP# As a result of this evaluation, priorities will be set in identifying a maximum number of countries for each project to be covered by the budget made available through EU support. #NP# Subsequently, projects will be implemented in the selected countries in four fields: #NP# 1. Strengthening the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials and other Radioactive Materials in Use, Storage and Transport and of Nuclear Facilities #NP# The materials used or stored at nuclear facilities and locations must be adequately accounted for and protected in order to prevent theft or sabotage. An effective regulatory system should identify those elements requiring implementation at the level of the State and of the operator respectively. #NP# A maximum of six countries will be selected for Project 1. #NP# 2. Strengthening of Security of Radioactive Materials in Non-Nuclear Applications #NP# This project includes two different activity areas, one dealing with establishing/upgrading regulatory infrastructure and one dealing with dismantling and disposal of disused sources. #NP# Radioactive materials are often used in non-nuclear applications, e.g. in medical or industrial use. Some of these sources are highly radioactive, and belong to categories 1 to 3, as defined in the IAEA document ""Categorisation of Radioactive Sources"". These sources, if not adequately under regulatory control and protected, may come into the wrong hands and be used in malicious activities. The radiation safety and security of radioactive sources as well as regulatory infrastructure must be effective and must function adequately in accordance with the international standards, the guidelines of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the best practices. A maximum of six countries will be selected for this activity area of Project 2. #NP# It is of vital importance that powerful and vulnerable sources are physically protected against malicious acts when used or stored, and when no longer required, they should be dismantled and disposed of as radioactive waste in a safe and secure storage. A maximum of six countries will be selected for this activity area of Project 2. #NP# 3. Strengthening of States‚Äô Capabilities for Detection and Response to Illicit Trafficking #NP# Illicit trafficking is a situation which relates to the unauthorised receipt, provision, use, transfer or disposal of nuclear material and other radioactive materials, whether intentional or unintentional and with or without crossing international borders. #NP# A terrorist-made, crude nuclear explosive device or a radiological dispersal device cannot be constructed without the material having been acquired as a result of illicit trafficking. In addition, sensitive equipment and technology to produce sensitive material for or to construct a crude nuclear explosive device may also have been acquired via illicit trafficking. It may be assumed that cross-border movement of material or technology is necessary for the material to reach its end destination. To combat illicit trafficking, states thus require the necessary regulatory systems to be in place, as well as technical systems (including user-friendly instruments) and available procedures and information at the border stations for detecting attempts at smuggling radioactive materials (including fissile, radioactive materials), or unauthorised trade with sensitive equipment and technology. #NP# Effective measures must also be in place to respond to such acts and also to seizures of any radioactive materials. Law enforcement staff (customs, police, etc.) is frequently not trained in the use of detection equipment, and thus the sensitive equipment and technology may be unfamiliar. Training of this staff is therefore critical to the success of any measures put in place for detection of illicit trafficking. Different training should be offered to staff of different categories, both in using detection instruments and in understanding the reading of the instrument, to be able to decide on follow-up activities. #NP# 4. Legislative Assistance for the Implementation of States‚Äô Obligations under IAEA Safeguards Agreements and Additional Protocols #NP# The conclusion of safeguards agreements and additional protocols with the IAEA is an effective measure that promotes stringent national and international control of nuclear material and related technologies. While there are some key commitments and elements that states are obliged to implement in national legislation with respect to safeguards, which are relevant to the security and control of nuclear material and nuclear-related material and activities, there are also other additional commitments that states are required to enact to enable them to comply with their international commitments under safeguards. In this respect national implementing legislation should actually provide a framework of principles and general provisions that enables authorised governmental entities to exercise the necessary regulatory functions and that regulates the conduct of any person engaged in regulated activities. #NP# It is important that national implementing legislation clearly identify the nuclear activities, installations, facilities and material to which safeguards will be applied. In addition, states that have concluded an additional protocol need to ensure that their national implementing legislation has been enhanced to enable the state concerned to comply with the additional obligations under the additional protocol. In particular, the state‚Äôs domestic legislation should be revised to expand the responsibilities and powers of the regulatory body, designated for the purposes of implementing and applying the safeguards agreements concluded. #NP# The beneficiaries of the project will be the selected target countries. #NP# 2. Objectives #NP# Overall objective: To strengthen nuclear security in selected countries. #NP# 2.1. Evaluation Phase: Financing International Nuclear Security Missions #NP# Evaluation will be carried out by the IAEA to identify needs to strengthen the nuclear security in each of those countries mentioned in point 1, in which such evaluation has not been completed. The evaluation will cover, as appropriate, physical protection and security of nuclear and non-nuclear applications, the necessary regulatory infrastructure for radiation safety and security of radioactive sources, as well as established measures to combat illicit trafficking. The results of the overall evaluation will be used as a basis in selecting the countries in which the projects will be implemented. #NP# The projects, as part of the broad-based nuclear security mission referred to above, will: #NP# - evaluate, in each country, the status of physical protection of nuclear and other radioactive materials, and the protection of any nuclear or research installation or location in which these materials are used or stored, and identify a subset of facilities and locations containing these materials to be selected for subsequent upgrading and support, #NP# - evaluate, in each country, any needs with respect to the upgrading of the security of radioactive sources, identify any weaknesses and shortcomings in implementing international standards and the Code of Conduct requiring improvement of regulatory infrastructure, and identify the need to provide additional protection of powerful, vulnerable sources. The specific equipment needed to provide protection would also be determined as a result of the evaluation, #NP# - evaluate, in each country, the current status of the capability to combat illicit trafficking and identify needs for the required improvements. #NP# 2.2. Implementation of specific actions defined as priorities as a result of the evaluation phase #NP# Project 1 #NP# Strengthening Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials and other Radioactive Materials in Use, Storage and Transport and in Nuclear Facilities #NP# Project purpose: to strengthen physical protection of nuclear and other radioactive materials in the selected countries. #NP# Project results: #NP# - physical protection of selected facilities and priority locations upgraded, #NP# - national regulatory infrastructure for physical protection improved through expert assistance, #NP# - staff training provided in the selected countries. #NP# Project 2 #NP# Strengthening of Security of Radioactive Materials in Non-Nuclear Applications #NP# Project purpose: to strengthen the security of radioactive materials in non-nuclear applications in the selected countries. #NP# Project results: #NP# - establishment/upgrading of the national regulatory infrastructure for radiation safety and security of radioactive sources through the provision of the Radiation Safety, and Security of Radioactive Sources, Infrastructure Appraisal (RaSSIA), advisory services, equipment and training, in accordance with the international standards, the guidelines of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the best practices, #NP# - vulnerable sources protected or, as appropriate, dismantled or disposed in selected countries. #NP# Project 3 #NP# Strengthening of States‚Äô Capabilities for Detection and Response to Illicit Trafficking #NP# Project purpose: to strengthen the States‚Äô capacities for detection of and response to illicit trafficking in the selected countries. #NP# Project results: #NP# - enhanced information collected and evaluated on illicit nuclear trafficking, from open sources and from states‚Äô points of contact, to improve the knowledge about and circumstances of illicit nuclear trafficking. This information will also facilitate the prioritisation of the various activities undertaken to combat illicit trafficking, #NP# - national frameworks established through expert assistance, to combat illicit trafficking and to improve the national coordination of control cross-border movements of radioactive materials, sensitive nuclear equipment and technology in the selected countries, #NP# - border monitoring equipment upgraded at selected border crossings, #NP# - training provided for law enforcement staff. #NP# Project 4 #NP# Legislative Assistance for the Implementation of States‚Äô Obligations under IAEA Safeguards Agreements and Additional Protocols #NP# Project purpose: to strengthen national legislative frameworks for the implementation of safeguards agreements and additional protocols concluded between states and the IAEA. #NP# The project consists of two phases, namely a preparatory phase and an implementation phase: #NP# - the preparatory phase consists of the identification of states that have not adopted the necessary implementing legislation pursuant to safeguards agreements and additional protocols concluded with the IAEA. This identification will be carried out by the EU. In addition, it includes the development of generic materials (i.e. ""legislative building blocks""), derived from examples of existing national legislation of various states, to be used as a basis for tailoring those examples to the respective national needs and conditions of the target countries, #NP# - the implementing phase consists of the provision of bilateral legislative assistance to target countries in the drafting and/or revision of national legislation, using the building blocks developed during the preparatory phase. #NP# Project results: #NP# - Development and adoption in national languages of national legislation necessary to enable states to comply with their obligations under IAEA safeguards agreements and additional protocols. #NP# 3. Duration #NP# The evaluation will be performed within a period of three months after entering into force of the EU Contribution Agreement between the Commission and the IAEA. The four projects will be performed in parallel during the 12 subsequent months. #NP# The total estimated duration for the implementation of this Joint Action is 15 months. #NP# 4. Beneficiaries #NP# The beneficiaries are the countries where the assessment and the subsequent projects will be implemented. Their authorities will be helped to identify weak points and receive support to find solutions for them and increase security. #NP# 5. Implementing Entity #NP# The IAEA will be entrusted with the implementation of the projects. The international nuclear security missions will be performed following the standard mode of operation for missions of the IAEA, which will be carried out by IAEA Member States‚Äô experts. The implementation of the four projects will be done directly by the IAEA staff, IAEA Member States selected experts or contractors. In the case of contractors, the procurement of any goods, works or services by the IAEA in the context of this Joint Action shall be carried out in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of the IAEA, as detailed in the EU Contribution Agreement with the IAEA. #NP# 6. Third Party Participants #NP# The projects will be financed 100 % by this Joint Action. Experts of IAEA Member States may be considered as third party participants. They will work under the standard rules of operation for IAEA experts. #NP# 7.

KG, a consortium of chemical companies for the construction of a pipeline for the transport of ethylene between Ludwigshafen to M√ºnchsm√ºnster. Ethylene is derived from petroleum and used for the production of polymers, which are then used to produce plastics. #NP# The pipeline will have a length of 357 km and a total cost of EUR 140 million. It will be operated along the principles ""common carrier"", ""open access"", ""non-discriminatory fees"" and ""minimum profit"". Any producer and user of ethylene will have access to use the pipeline under the same conditions. There would be sufficient spare capacity to ensure the respect of these principles. These principles must be respected for at least 25 years. #NP# The beneficiary is Ethylene Pipeline S√ºd GmbH %amp% Co. KG, a consortium of BASF AG, Borealis Polymere GmbH, Clariant GmbH, OMV Deutschland GmbH, Ruhr Oel GmbH, Vinnolit Gmbh%amp%Co KG and Wacker Chemie GmbH. #NP# Pipeline transport is safer and more environmentally-friendly than transport by rail, waterway or road. A well developed pipeline network would carry strategic importance for the producers and consumers of ethylene in the region. #NP# In its preliminary assessment, the Commission finds that the support from the German authorities, the Commission constitutes State aid and not a general infrastructure measure. The Commission doubts whether the aid can be considered compatible with the common market. The benefits in terms of environmental protection, transport safety and road congestion appear to be inexistent or small at best. The pipeline may be of strategic importance for the chemical industry in the region, but it may create an undue distortion of competition. The profitability calculated for the project is low, but the advantages for the existing ethylene and propylene producers may be significant. The pipeline may enable significant transport between companies along the line, but it may also create possibilities to supply ethylene to further regions, where it may compete directly with ethylene from other suppliers outside Bavaria and Baden Wurttemberg. Important effects on the propylene market are not excluded either. #NP# This project to some extent similar to the propylene pipeline running from Rotterdam, via Antwerp to the German Ruhr Area, cases C67, 68 and 69/03, for which the Commission approved aid on 16 June 2004 [1]. However, there are three important differences: 1) Currently, there is no substantial ethylene transport at all between the two extremes of the pipeline, whereas waterways and rail constituted a reasonable alternative in the case of the propylene pipeline; 2) unlike in the case of the propylene pipeline there are rebates in the transport fees for larger quantities, long-term contracts and advance booking. The Commission doubts whether this would not lead to disproportionate benefits to the companies in the consortium as compared to other users. 3) In the present case the aid intensity is 50 %, instead of just below 30 % in the other case. #NP# In the light of these doubts, the Commission decided to initiate the formal investigation procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty, inviting interest parties to submit their comments. #NP# TEXT OF LETTER #NP# ""Die Kommission teilt der Bundesrepublik Deutschland mit, dass sie nach Pr√ºfung der von den deutschen Beh√∂rden √ºber die vorerw√§hnte Ma√ünahme √ºbermittelten Angaben beschlossen hat, das Verfahren nach Artikel 88 Absatz 2 EG-Vertrag einzuleiten. #NP# 1. VERFAHREN #NP# (1) Am 2. Dezember 2003 teilte die Bundesregierung der Kommission ihre Absicht mit, die geplante F√∂rderung eines Pipeline-Projekts zwischen Ludwigshafen (Baden-W√ºrttemberg) und M√ºnchsm√ºnster (Bayern) zu notifizieren. #NP# (2) Am 12. Januar 2005 meldeten die deutschen Beh√∂rden die besagte Ma√ünahme, die ihres Erachtens eine allgemeine Infrastrukturma√ünahme und keine staatliche Beihilfe darstellt, aus Gr√ºnden der Rechtssicherheit f√∂rmlich an. #NP# 2. AUSF√úHRLICHE BESCHREIBUNG DES VORHABENS, EMPF√ÑNGER UND BEIHILFE #NP# 2.1 Die Ethylenindustrie #NP# (3) Etyhlen, ein farbloses Gas, ist der einfachste unges√§ttigte Kohlenwasserstoff (Alken) und hat die chemische Formel CH2=CH2. Dieses Olefin wird gew√∂hnlich aus Erd√∂l in petrochemischen Anlagen (so genannten Steamcrackern) gewonnen; dabei entstehen Ethylen und Propylen in einem festen Verh√§ltnis. Ethylen bildet die Grundlage f√ºr eine breite Palette von Polymeren (z. B. Polyethylen, PVC und Polystyrol), die ihrerseits zur Herstellung von Kunststoffen f√ºr zahlreiche Anwendungen verwendet werden. #NP# (4) Nach deutschen Angaben verf√ºgte Westeuropa Ende 2002 √ºber eine Produktionskapazit√§t von 23,2 Mio. Tonnen, von denen mehr als 10 Mio. Tonnen allein auf Deutschland und die Benelux-L√§nder entfielen. Zwischen 2002 und 2003 stieg die Produktion um 2,6 % auf 20,7 Mio. Tonnen. Da der Verbrauch in Westeuropa die Produktion √ºbersteigt, mussten 2002 0,24 Mio. Tonnen importiert werden. Voraussichtlich d√ºrfte der Verbrauch in den kommenden Jahren um ca. 2 % j√§hrlich zunehmen. In Mitteleuropa belief sich die Produktionskapazit√§t Ende 2002 auf 2,24 Mio. Tonnen, der Verbrauch erreichte 2 Mio. Tonnen und d√ºrfte in den kommenden Jahren um 5,5 % j√§hrlich wachsen. #NP# (5) Ethylen ist ein narkotisierendes, erstickendes, leicht entflammbares Gas, das mit der Luft explosionsf√§hige Gemische bildet und der h√∂chsten Gefahrenklasse zugeordnet wird. Aus Sicherheitsgr√ºnden erfolgt der Transport √ºberwiegend durch Pipelines; f√ºr den Stra√üen- und Schienentransport gelten strenge Auflagen. #NP# (6) In Europa gibt es derzeit mehrere regionale Ethylenleitungssysteme, die nicht zu einem zusammenh√§ngenden Netz verbunden sind und nur etwa 50 % der Gesamtkapazit√§t erfassen: #NP# - Nordwesteuropa (Rotterdam ‚Äî Ludwigshafen); dazu geh√∂rt die Pipeline der Aethylen-RohrleitungGesellschaft ARG, #NP# - Mitteleuropa (Stade ‚Äî Leuna ‚Äî Neratovice), #NP# - Frankreich (Marseille/Berre ‚Äî Feyzin ‚Äî Carling), #NP# - Norditalien (Ravenna ‚Äî Porto Marghera ‚Äî Mantua), #NP# - Bayern (M√ºnchsm√ºnster ‚Äî Gendorf), #NP# - Osteuropa (Slowakei ‚Äî Ukraine). #NP# F√ºr das verbundene Produkt Propylen bestehen im Gebiet der Benelux-L√§nder separate Leitungssysteme. Diese Einzelsysteme sollen miteinander verbunden und erweitert werden, um ein ausgedehnteres Leitungsnetz f√ºr Olefine zu schaffen. Die zur Pr√ºfung anstehende Pipeline w√§re Teil dieses Netzes [2]. #NP# (7) Laut Anmeldung verliert die petrochemische Industrie in Europa an Wettbewerbsf√§higkeit und der Bau eines europ√§ischen Ethylenpipelinenetzes w√ºrde diesem Trend dadurch entgegenwirken, dass mehr Flexibilit√§t geschaffen, regionale Engp√§sse bei der Rohstoffversorgung weitgehend beseitigt und eine h√∂here Versorgungssicherheit erreicht w√ºrde. #NP# 2.2 Der Empf√§nger #NP# (8) Die Beihilfe soll der Ethylen-Pipeline-S√ºd GmbH %amp% Co. KG (in der Folge: EPS), einem Konsortium der petrochemischen Unternehmen BASF AG, Borealis Polymere GmbH, Clariant GmbH, OMV Deutschland GmbH, Ruhr Oel GmbH, Vinnolit Gmbh%amp%Co KG und Wacker Chemie GmbH gew√§hrt werden. Die Herstellung und die Lieferungen zwischen diesen Unternehmen sind zusammengefasst in Tabelle 1. #NP# In Tonnen (Zahlen f√ºr 2003) | OMV Deutschland GmbH, Burghausen | Ruhr Oel GmbH, M√ºnchsm√ºnster | #NP# Basell GmbH, M√ºnchsm√ºnster | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Clariant GmbH, Gendorf | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Vinnolit GmbH%amp%Co.KG, Gendorf | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Borealis Polymere GmbH, Burghausen | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Wacker-Chemie, Burghausen | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Gesamtproduktion | 350000 | 320000 | #NP# 2.3 Das Vorhaben #NP# (9) Die geplante Pipeline mit einer L√§nge von 357 Km wird von Ludwigshafen nach M√ºnchsm√ºnster f√ºhren und eine j√§hrliche Gesamtkapazit√§t von 400000 Tonnen erreichen. Derzeit wird zwischen Ludwigshafen und M√ºnchsm√ºnster kein Ethylen transportiert. Die erwarteten Transportmengen werden in Tabelle 2 ausgewiesen. Da sich Produktion und Verbrauch von Ethylen ungleich entwickeln, wird in den ersten Jahren ein Nettofluss in Richtung Ludwigshafen erwartet, w√§hrend es in sp√§teren Jahren umgekehrt sein d√ºrfte. #NP# | 2008-2009 | 2010-2014 | Ab 2015 | #NP# Hersteller | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# OMV | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Ruhr Oel | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Abnehmer | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Wacker | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Borealis | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Clariant | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Vinnolit | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Basell | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Neue Investoren | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | [‚Ä¶] | #NP# Nettotransport | 140 | 80 | 200 | #NP# (10) Das Durchleitungsentgelt wird anhand der Tarife der Aethylen-Rohrleitung-Gesellschaft festgesetzt. Auf einen Grundtarif von 22,742 je mT werden 0,11371 je mT und Kilometer zugeschlagen. Wer die Durchleitung 30 Tage im Voraus beantragt, erh√§lt einen Rabatt von 15 %. F√ºr langfristige Vertr√§ge wird ein Nachlass gew√§hrt, der f√ºr Vertr√§ge mit einer Laufzeit von mindestens sechs Jahren bis zu 21 % betragen kann. Ebenfalls vorgesehen ist ein Mengenrabatt von 0,5 % je 10000 Tonnen. Der so errechnete Mindesttarif w√ºrde 34,21 EUR je Tonne f√ºr die gesamte Pipelinestrecke betragen. Durch ""Swapping"" k√∂nnten auch Abnehmer ohne langfristige Vertr√§ge von Tarifen zwischen 34 und 35 EUR profitieren. Diese Tarife, die f√ºr Mitglieder des Konsortiums und andere Pipelinenutzer gleicherma√üen gelten, werden j√§hrlich auf Grundlage einer unabh√§ngigen Bewertung angepasst. #NP# (11) Die Gesamtkosten der geplanten Pipeline belaufen sich auf 140 Mio. EUR. Nach vorbereitenden rechtlichen Schritten d√ºrften bis 2006 Studien erstellt und 2007 mit dem Bau der Pipeline begonnen werden; die Inbetriebnahme ist f√ºr September 2007 geplant. Im Rahmen des Verfahrens zur Erlangung der n√∂tigen Genehmigungen wird eine Umweltvertr√§glichkeitspr√ºfung durchgef√ºhrt der in Einklang mit der Richtlinie 85/337/EWG des Rates vom 27. Juni 1985 √ºber die Umweltvertr√§glichkeitspr√ºfung bei bestimmten √∂ffentlichen und privaten Projekten [4] stehen muss. #NP# (12) Die geplante Pipeline wird nach dem Common Carrier-Prinzip des gleichen Zugangs zu unterschiedslosen Konditionen sowie dem Minimum Profit-Prinzip betrieben. Alle Ethylenproduzenten und -abnehmer werden die Pipeline zu nicht diskriminierenden Bedingungen in Anspruch nehmen k√∂nnen. Die Kapazit√§t der Pipeline wird so ausgelegt, dass diese Prinzipien respektiert werden k√∂nnen (die verf√ºgbare Reservekapazit√§t betr√§gt ca. 50 %). Diese Bedingungen m√ºssen mindestens 25 Jahre eingehalten werden. #NP# (13) Laut den deutschen Beh√∂rden wird das Vorhaben die Zukunft der petrochemischen Industrie in Bayern und die ca. 17700 Arbeitspl√§tze der Branche langfristig sichern. Die Pipeline stellt den Anschluss an bestehende Rohrleitungen zwischen M√ºnchsm√ºnster und Gendorf/Burghausen sowie zwischen Ludwigshafen und Wesseling her. Au√üerdem kann eine Erweiterung in Betracht gezogen werden, wie: #NP# - in die Tschechische Republik, z. B. M√ºnchsm√ºnster-Litvinov, einschlie√ülich der M√∂glichkeit eines Kreissystems in Mitteleuropa; #NP# - nach Italien und Kroatien, z. B. Burghausen-Porto Maghiera, #NP# - nach √ñsterreich, z. B. Burghausen-Schwechat mit der Option einer weiteren Verbindung √ºber die Slowakei nach Ungarn; #NP# - nach Frankreich, z. B. Ludwigshafen-Carling. #NP# 2.4 Die Beihilfe #NP# (14) Der Freistaat Bayern beabsichtigt, einen Zuschuss in H√∂he von 70 Mio. EUR zu gew√§hren, das entspricht 50 % der Investitionskosten. Die F√∂rderung d√ºrfte sich auf 2,25 Mio. EUR im Jahr 2004, 3,9 Mio. EUR im Jahr 2005, 20,1 Mio. EUR im Jahr 2006, 43 Mio. EUR im Jahr 2007 und 0,75 Mio. EUR im Jahr 2008 belaufen. Sollte der Gesamtbetrag der Investition niedriger sein als die veranschlagten 140 Mio. EUR, w√ºrde der Zuschuss anteilig gek√ºrzt. #NP# (15) Wie Deutschland betont, w√§re das Projekt ohne die F√∂rderung wirtschaftlich nicht rentabel; die Transportkosten w√§ren weitaus h√∂her (54,6 EUR je Tonne) und nicht mehr wettbewerbsf√§hig. Des Weiteren wird hervorgehoben, dass selbst mit der geplanten F√∂rderung in H√∂he von 70 Mio. EUR die erwartete Rendite f√ºr EPS bei nur 1,3 % liegt. Dies zeigt nach Auffassung der deutschen Beh√∂rden, dass die beteiligten Unternehmen in erster Linie an der langfristigen Versorgungssicherheit und nicht an kurzfristigen Gewinnen interessiert sind. #NP# 3. W√úRDIGUNG #NP# (16) Gem√§√ü Artikel 6 der Verordnung (EG) Nr. 659/1999 des Rates vom 22. M√§rz 1999 √ºber besondere Vorschriften f√ºr die Anwendung von Artikel [88] des EG-Vertrags [5] enth√§lt die Entscheidung √ºber die Er√∂ffnung des f√∂rmlichen Pr√ºfverfahrens eine vorl√§ufige W√ºrdigung des Beihilfecharakters der geplanten Ma√ünahme durch die Kommission und Ausf√ºhrungen √ºber ihre Bedenken hinsichtlich der Vereinbarkeit mit dem gemeinsamen Markt. #NP# 3.1 Vorliegen einer staatlichen Beihilfe im Sinne von Artikel 87 Absatz 1 EG-Vertrag #NP# (17) Gem√§√ü Artikel 87 Absatz 1 EG-Vertrag sind staatliche oder aus staatlichen Mitteln gew√§hrte Beihilfen gleich welcher Art, die durch die Beg√ºnstigung bestimmter Unternehmen oder Produktionszweige den Wettbewerb verf√§lschen oder zu verf√§lschen drohen, mit dem Gemeinsamen Markt unvereinbar, soweit sie den Handel zwischen Mitgliedstaaten beeintr√§chtigen. #NP# (18) Die staatliche Finanzierung des Baus oder Betriebs von Verkehrsinfrastrukturen wird nicht immer als staatliche Beihilfe im Sinne von Artikel 87 Absatz 1 EG-Vertrag angesehen. Im vorliegenden Fall stellt die Kommission jedoch Folgendes fest: #NP# - Der Pipelinebetreiber EPS √ºbt eindeutig eine wirtschaftliche T√§tigkeit aus, die in der Bereitstellung von Infrastruktur f√ºr Transportleistungen besteht. In anderen Worten, EPS bietet Dienstleistungen auf dem Transportmarkt an und ist daher als Unternehmen im Sinne von Artikel 87 Absatz 1 zu betrachten; #NP# - die Beihilfe erm√∂glicht es dem Konsortium, die Pipeline zu bauen und 25 Jahrelang zu betreiben, ohne daf√ºr die gesamten Kosten zu tragen, so dass sich ein wirtschaftlicher Vorteil ergibt. #NP# - Der Vorteil ist aus folgenden Gr√ºnden als selektiv zu betrachten: #NP# - Die Pipeline eignet sich nur f√ºr den Ethylentransport. Alle unmittelbar Beteiligten sind Ethylenhersteller, die ein direktes Interesse an der Pipeline haben. #NP# - Deutschland hat f√ºr den Bau und den Betrieb der Pipeline keine √∂ffentliche Ausschreibung durchgef√ºhrt, sondern lediglich auf eine Privatinitiative reagiert. #NP# - Die Pipeline verbleibt im Eigentum des Konsortiums. Die Bedingungen bez√ºglich dem offenen Zugang, dem Common Carrier-Prinzip und dem Prinzip des geringen Gewinns, die als Voraussetzung f√ºr die Beihilfegew√§hrung angef√ºhrt werden, gelten nur f√ºr 25 Jahre. #NP# Nach st√§ndiger Rechtsprechung der europ√§ischen Gerichte ist das Kriterium der Handelsbeeintr√§chtigung erf√ºllt, wenn das beg√ºnstigte Unternehmen einer Wirtschaftst√§tigkeit nachgeht, die Gegenstand eines Handels zwischen Mitgliedstaaten ist. Betrachtet man nicht nur Ethylen, sondern auch Propylen und die Folgeprodukte beider Gase, so stellt die Kommission fest, dass sich die am Konsortium beteiligten Unternehmen in Branchen bet√§tigen, in denen ein Handel zwischen Mitgliedstaaten stattfindet. #NP# (19) Diese W√ºrdigung weist gewisse Parallelen zu den Beihilfesachen C67/03, C68/03 und C69/03; dabei geht es um eine Beihilfe, die Deutschland, die Niederlande und Belgien f√ºr den Bau einer Propylen-Pipeline von Rotterdam √ºber Antwerpen ins Ruhrgebiet gew√§hren. In diesen Beihilfesachen hat die Kommission eine Positiventscheidung erlassen und deutlich gemacht, dass die F√∂rderung eine staatliche Beihilfe darstellt [6]. #NP# (20) Die vorstehenden √úberlegungen f√ºhren zu der vorl√§ufigen Schlussfolgerung, dass die angemeldete Ma√ünahme in den Geltungsbereich des Artikels 87 Absatz 1 EG-Vertrag f√§llt und als staatliche Beihilfe anzusehen ist. #NP# 3.2 Vereinbarkeit #NP# (21) Artikel 87 Abs√§tze 2 und 3 des Vertrags sehen bestimmte Ausnahmen vom allgemeinen Beihilfeverbot in Absatz 1 vor. Die Kommission hat verschiedene Leitlinien und Gemeinschaftsrahmen erlassen, die im Einzelnen festlegen, welche Beihilfen unter diese Ausnahmebestimmungen fallen. Im vorliegenden Fall scheinen keine dieser Leitlinien oder Gemeinschaftsrahmen zur Anwendung zu gelangen. #NP# (22) Die Leitlinien f√ºr staatliche Beihilfen mit regionaler Zielsetzung [7] sind nicht anwendbar, weil die Investition nicht in einem F√∂rdergebiet durchgef√ºhrt wird. Effektiv ist Bayern das reichste Bundesland. #NP# (23) Auch der Gemeinschaftsrahmen f√ºr staatliche Umweltschutzbeihilfen [8] ist nicht anwendbar. Der Ethylentransport √ºber eine Pipeline kann nicht als Anpassung des Verfahrens zur Ethylenherstellung im Sinne des Umweltschutzes angesehen werden, sondern ist als gesonderte Dienstleistung zu betrachten. Dass die Pipeline von einem neuen Rechtssubjekt errichtet wird, das einzig und allein zu dem Zweck gegr√ºndet wurde, Transportleistungen f√ºr Ethylen zu erbringen, k√∂nnte den Unterschied zur Ethylenherstellung illustrieren. Wenngleich sich die Anteilseigener von EPS in der Ethylenherstellung und -verarbeitung bet√§tigen, geht es bei der neuen Aktivit√§t in erster Linie um eine Transportaktivit√§t. Au√üerdem haben die deutschen Beh√∂rden in der Anmeldung der Beihilfe nicht gezeigt, dass es einen positiven Beitrag zum Umweltschutz gibt. Zurzeit findet kein Ethylentransport zwischen Ludwigshafen und M√ºnchsm√ºnster statt und wegen der prohibitiven Sicherungskosten kann ein solcher Transport ohne die geplante Pipeline auch nicht erwartet werden. Zwar argumentiert Deutschland, das Transportvolumen k√∂nnte sich verringern, da Ethylenhersteller und -abnehmer mehr Flexibilit√§t bei der Wahl des Produktionsstandorts entlang der Pipeline h√§tten. Doch w√§re dies vorerst noch ungewiss und deshalb bezweifelt die Kommission, dass dies die Beihilfe rechtfertigen k√∂nnte. #NP# (24) Da die geltenden Leitlinien oder Gemeinschaftsrahmen nicht zur Anwendung gelangen, st√ºtzt sich die vorl√§ufige W√ºrdigung der Beihilfe unmittelbar auf Artikel 87 Absatz 3 Buchstabe c. Effektiv hat die Kommission die Beihilfe f√ºr die Propylenpipeline in den vorgenannten Beihilfesachen C67/03, C68/03 und C69/03 auf dieser Grundlage genehmigt, da sich gewichtige Vorteile f√ºr Umwelt und Industrie ergaben: Verminderung der Emissionen, Entlastung der Stra√üe, verbesserte Transportsicherheit und ""strategische Bedeutung f√ºr den Fortbestand der chemischen Industrie"" in der Region. Das Fehlen geeigneter Infrastrukturen steht in scharfem Gegensatz zu dem fl√§chendeckenden Pipelinenetz in den USA. Von dem Projekt w√ºrden auch Propylenhersteller in anderen Teilen der EU profitieren, in denen es ein Propylen√ºberhang gibt, wie im Vereinigten K√∂nigreich und in Spanien. Jede Wettbewerbsverzerrung auf dem Propylenmarkt w√ºrde dadurch eingeschr√§nkt, dass alle Wettbewerber freien Zugang zur Pipeline haben. #NP# (25) Zwar k√∂nnen im anstehenden Fall in gewissem Ma√üe dieselben Argumente angef√ºhrt werden, doch gibt es drei wesentliche Unterschiede zu dem fr√ºheren Fall. #NP# (26) Der erste Unterschied ist, dass nach deutschen Angaben derzeit kein Ethylen zwischen Ludwigshafen und M√ºnchsm√ºnster transportiert wird. Folglich bezweifelt die Kommission in ihrer vorl√§ufigen W√ºrdigung, wie schon oben in Punkt 23 erkl√§rt, dass sich direkte Vorteile in Bezug auf Umwelt, Transportsicherheit und Entlastung der Stra√üe ergeben. Dies w√ºrde im Gegensatz zum Fall der Propylenpipeline stehen, wo der Transport auf dem Schienen- und Wasserwege eine echte Alternative f√ºr die Industrie ist und die Pipeline zu einer Nettoreduktion der Emissionen, mehr Transportsicherheit und einer Entlastung der Stra√üe f√ºhren wird. #NP# (27) Dieser Unterschied k√∂nnte auch eine andere Art von Vorteilen f√ºr die beteiligten Unternehmen beinhalten. Im Falle der Propylenpipeline ist der finanzielle Nutzen f√ºr Propylenhersteller und -abnehmer gering, da sich die Tarife an denen konkurrierender Bef√∂rderungsmittel orientieren. Der Nutzen besteht vielmehr in einer gr√∂√üeren Versorgungsflexibilit√§t. Im vorliegenden Fall hingegen sind die Nutzwirkungen f√ºr Ethylenhersteller und -abnehmer in Bayern ganz anderer Art, da die Pipeline den Ethylentransport dort erm√∂glicht, wo es bisher keinen derartigen Transport gab. Mit der Pipeline kann Ethylen zu ""marktkonformen Tarifen"" transportiert werden, aber derzeit sind die Transportkosten aus Sicherheitsgr√ºnden prohibitiv hoch und dadurch gibt es heute gar keinen Transportmarkt f√ºr Ethylen im betroffenen Gebiet. #NP# (28) Die Rendite von 1,3 % f√ºr EPS ist f√ºr private Unternehmen niedrig und liegt unter den 5,6 % des Propylenprojekts, das Gegenstand der vorgenannten Positiventscheidung der Kommission war. Dass das Konsortium eine geringe Rentabilit√§t akzeptiert, schlie√üt jedoch hohe Gewinne der beteiligten Unternehmen nicht aus. Da es keine geeigneten Transportm√∂glichkeiten f√ºr Ethylen gibt und Ethylen und Propylen in einem fixen Verh√§ltnis produziert werden, sollten bei der Rentabilit√§tsbewertung der Pipeline auch andere (bisherige oder k√ºnftige) Investitionen der Beg√ºnstigten in die Ethylen- und Propylenproduktion ber√ºcksichtigt werden. Die Pipeline k√∂nnte sich beispielsweise direkt auf die Rentabilit√§t der Ethylen- und Propylenproduktion auswirken, indem Absatzm√§rkte f√ºr √ºbersch√ºssiges Ethylen au√üerhalb der Region erschlossen werden. Die Kommission kann nicht einmal ausschlie√üen, dass das Konsortium das Projekt angesichts der Bedeutung f√ºr andere T√§tigkeiten auch ohne Beihilfe, selbst mit Verlust realisieren w√ºrde. In diesem Fall h√§tte die Beihilfe keinen Anreizeffekt. #NP# (29) Da es derzeit keinen Ethylentransport gibt, k√∂nnten sich weit gr√∂√üere Auswirkungen auf die chemische Industrie in anderen Regionen ergeben. Wie aus Tabelle 2 hervorgeht, wird es offensichtlich einen beachtlichen Nettofluss von Ethylen aus der Region geben. Wenn dies das Ergebnis einer Produktionssteigerung ist, d√ºrfte dies mit einem Nettor√ºckgang des Propylentransports in die Region (oder einer Nettoerh√∂hung des Propylentransports aus der Region) einhergehen. Beide Entwicklungen d√ºrften erhebliche Auswirkungen auf Wettbewerber innerhalb und au√üerhalb Deutschlands haben. #NP# (30) Dar√ºber hinaus ist nicht klar, inwieweit die Pipeline Unternehmen zugute kommt, die sich nicht an dem Konsortium beteiligen. Eine Kl√§rung ist erforderlich nicht nur in Bezug auf Dritte innerhalb der Region, aber auch f√ºr andere Regionen. Mit Bezug auf Wettbewerber innerhalb der Region bemerkt der Kommission, dass Basell GmbH, z.B. eine wichtige Nutzer der Pipeline sein soll, was im Gegensatz zur Position der BASF AG steht, f√ºr die keine Transportstr√∂me geplant sind, aber die doch am Konsortium teilnimmt. #NP# (31) Deutschland behauptet, das Projekt trage zur Verbesserung der europ√§ischen Verkehrsinfrastruktur bei und sei ein notwendiger Baustein f√ºr die Erweiterung des Pipelinenetzes. Nach Auffassung der Kommission wird jedoch in der Anmeldung nicht hinreichend begr√ºndet, weshalb dieses spezifische Teilst√ºck von so besonderem Interesse ist. Verbessert werden die M√∂glichkeiten f√ºr Ethylenhersteller entlang der Pipelines, an denen das neue Teilst√ºck angebunden wird. Allerdings ist nicht klar, inwieweit ein Bedarf an gr√∂√üerer Flexibilit√§t besteht. Vielmehr d√ºrfte ein versch√§rfter Wettbewerb durch Ethylenanbieter aus Bayern entstehen. Die Kommission zweifelt auch deshalb an der Stichhaltigkeit des Arguments, weil einige Teilabschnitte des Netzes noch gebaut werden m√ºssen. Deren Bau ist offensichtlich nicht gesichert, er k√∂nnte umfangreiche Beihilfen erfordern und m√∂glicherweise werden nicht alle Abschnitte des Netzes nach den Common Carrier-Prinzip des offenen Zugangs bei geringer Gewinnerzielung betrieben. #NP# (32) Der zweite Unterschied zur Propylenpipeline betrifft die Mengenrabatte und die erm√§√üigten Tarife f√ºr langfristige Vertr√§ge und im Voraus bestellte Transportkapazit√§ten. Die Kommission hat Bedenken, dass sich daraus unverh√§ltnism√§√üige Vorteile f√ºr die Unternehmen des Konsortiums verglichen mit anderen Pipelinenutzern ergeben k√∂nnten und es ist nicht klar, inwieweit solche unverh√§ltnism√§√üigen Vorteile durch ""Swapping"" verringert w√ºrden. #NP# (33) Der dritte Unterschied zur Propylensache ist, dass die Beihilfeintensit√§t im vorliegenden Fall 50 % betr√§gt, verglichen mit knapp 30 % im Falle der Propylenpipeline. Eines der Argumente f√ºr die Positiventscheidung in letzterer Sache war, dass die Beihilfeintensit√§t unter dem in Randziff. 29 des Gemeinschaftsrahmens f√ºr Umweltschutzbeihilfen festgesetzten H√∂chstsatz lag, was analog eine Orientierung bot. Eine Analogie zum anstehenden Fall l√§sst sich nicht herstellen. Vielmehr verst√§rkt die hohe Beihilfeintensit√§t noch die von der Kommission erhobenen Bedenken, obwohl in einigen fr√ºheren Entscheidungen [9] wo der Zugang zur Infrastruktur offen war und zu unterschiedslosen Konditionen allen potentiellen Nutzern zur Verf√ºgung stand, eine Beihilfeintensit√§t von bis 50 % als akzeptabel angesehen worden ist. Jedoch muss festgestellt worden, dass es bei diesen fr√ºheren Entscheidungen z.B. um Schienen- und Binnenschifffahrtsinfrastrukturprojekte, und nicht um Pipelinetransporte ging. Au√üerdem betrifft die Pipeline die Transportinfrastruktur des gesamten Streckennetzes und nicht nur bestimmte Standorte oder einen bestimmten Streckenabschnitt. Weiterhin kann die Infrastruktur nur f√ºr Ethylen in Anspruch genommen werden. Sie ist f√ºr die Bef√∂rderung anderer Produkte von keinerlei Nutzen. Dar√ºber hinaus werden die Betreiber gleichzeitig die wesentlichen Nutzer der Pipeline sein. #NP# (34) Alle anderen Ausnahmebestimmungen des Vertrags scheinen im anstehenden Fall nicht anwendbar. Daher bezweifelt die Kommission, dass die Beihilfe als mit dem Gemeinsamen Markt vereinbar angesehen werden kann. #NP# 4. SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG #NP# (35) Aufgrund der vorstehenden Ausf√ºhrungen fordert die Kommission Deutschland gem√§√ü dem Verfahren nach Artikel 88 Absatz 2 EG-Vertrag auf, innerhalb eines Monats nach Erhalt dieses Schreibens Stellung zu nehmen und alle f√ºr die W√ºrdigung der Beihilfe sachdienlichen Informationen zu √ºbermitteln. #NP# (36) Die Kommission erinnert Deutschland an die Sperrwirkung des Artikels 88 Absatz 3 EG-Vertrag und verweist auf Artikel 14 der Verordnung (EG) Nr. 659/1999 des Rates, wonach alle rechtswidrigen Beihilfen vom Empf√§nger zur√ºckgefordert werden k√∂nnen. #NP# (37) Die Kommission teilt Deutschland mit, dass sie die Beteiligten durch die Ver√∂ffentlichung des vorliegenden Schreibens und einer aussagekr√§ftigen Zusammenfassung dieses Schreibens im Amtsblatt der Europ√§ischen Union von der Beihilfe in Kenntnis setzen wird. Au√üerdem wird sie den Beteiligten in den EFTA-Staaten, die das EWR-Abkommen unterzeichnet haben, durch die Ver√∂ffentlichung einer Bekanntmachung in der EWR-Beilage im Amtsblatt und die EFTA-√úberwachungsbeh√∂rde durch √úbermittlung einer Kopie dieses Schreibens von dem Vorgang in Kenntnis setzen.
